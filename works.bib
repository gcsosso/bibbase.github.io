abstract = {Nanowires made of chalcogenide alloys are of interest for use in phase-change nonvolatile memories. For this application, insights into the thermal properties of such nanowires and, in particular, into the crystallization kinetics at the atomic level are crucial. Toward this end, we have performed large-scale atomistic simulations of ultrathin nanowires (9 nm in diameter) of the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. We made use of an interatomic potential generated by the neural network fitting of a large ab initio database to compute the thermal properties of the nanowires. By melting a portion of a nanowire, we investigated the velocity of recrystallization as a function of temperature. The simulations show that the melting temperature of the nanowire is about 100 K below the melting temperature of the bulk, which yields a reduction by about a factor of 2 of the maximum crystallization speed. Further, analysis of the structural properties of the amorphous phase of the nanowire suggests a possible ori...},

abstract = {Non-bonded potentials are included in most force fields and therefore widely used in classical molecular dynamics simulations of materials and interfacial phenomena. It is commonplace to truncate these potentials for computational efficiency based on the assumption that errors are negligible for reasonable cutoffs or compensated for by adjusting other interaction parameters. Arising from a metadynamics study of the wetting transition of water on a solid substrate, we find that the influence of the cutoff is unexpectedly strong and can change the character of the wetting transition from continuous to first order by creating artificial metastable wetting states. Common cutoff corrections such as the use of a force switching function, a shifted potential, or a shifted force do not avoid this. Such a qualitative difference urges caution and suggests that using truncated non-bonded potentials can induce unphysical behavior that cannot be fully accounted for by adjusting other interaction parameters.},

We first show that ammonium fluoride (NH{\$}{\_}4{\$}F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes a pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is not amorphous but NH{\$}{\_}4{\$}F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV. This collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In the case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a deviation from this mechanism and we therefore classify HDA as a 'derailed' state along the ice I to ice IV pathway.},

We show how this method can be used to define collective variables and how these collective variables can be used to enhance the sampling of nucleation events. We then show how this method can be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy.

We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous freezing. The critical nucleus is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface. Kaolinite also promotes the exclusive nucleation of hexagonal ice, as opposed to homogeneous freezing where a mixture of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is observed.},

Despite the importance of heterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to microbiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still prevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the ability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a function of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation rates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal, varying the water–surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It turns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice, customarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice nucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other hand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity can significantly alter the ice nucleation ...},

By means of combined molecular dynamics and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory, we have unraveled the atomistic origin of the resistance drift in the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. The drift results from a widening of the band gap and a reduction of Urbach tails due to structural relaxations leading to the removal of chains of Ge-Ge homopolar bonds.

The fast crystallization has been ascribed to the persistence of a high atomic mobility in the supercooled liquid phase, down to temperatures close to the glass transition. In this work we unravel the atomistic, structural origin of this feature in the supercooled liquid state of GeTe, a prototypical phase change compound, by means of molecular dynamic simulations. To this end, we employed an interatomic potential based on a neural network framework, which allows simulating thousands of atoms for tens of ns by keeping an accuracy close to that of the underlying first-principles framework. Our findings demonstrate that the high atomic mobility is related to the presence of clusters of slow and fast moving atoms. The latter contain a large fraction of chains of homopolar Ge-Ge bonds, which at low temperatures have a tendency to move by discontinuous cage-jump rearrangements. This structural fingerprint of dynamical heterogeneity provides an explanation of the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in GeTe, which is the ultimate origin of the fast crystallization of phase change materials exploited in the devices.},

GeTe is a phase change material of interest for applications in nonvolatile memories. An interatomic potential with close-to-ab initio accuracy was used as generated by fitting a huge ab initio database with a neural network method. It turns out that the majority of heat carriers are nonpropagating vibrations (diffusons), the small percentage of propagating modes giving a negligible contribution to the total value of $\kappa$. This result is in contrast with the properties of other amorphous semiconductors such as Si for which nonpropagating and propagating vibrations account for about one half of the value of $\kappa$ each. This outcome suggests that the value of $\kappa$ measured for the bulk amorphous phase can be used to model the thermal transport of GeTe and possibly of other materials in the same class also in nanoscaled memory devices. Actually, the contribution from propagating modes, which may endure ballistic transport at the scale of 10–20 nm, is negligible. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.104301 PACS number(s): 65.60.+a, 84.35.+i},

abstract = {GeTe is a prototypical phase change material of high interest for applications in optical and electronic non-volatile memories. We present an interatomic potential for the bulk phases of GeTe, which is created using a neural network (NN) representation of the potential-energy surface obtained from reference calculations based on density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the NN potential provides a close to ab initio quality description of a number of properties of liquid, crystalline and amorphous GeTe. The availability of a reliable classical potential allows addressing a number of issues of interest for the technological applications of phase change materials, which are presently beyond the capability of first principles molecular dynamics simulations.},

abstract = {We computed the Raman spectrum of cubic and amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) by ab initio phonons and an empirical bond polarizability model. Models of the amorphous phase were generated by quenching from the melt by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated spectra are in good agreement with experimental data which confirms the reliability of the models of the amorphous phase emerged from the simulations.All the features of the spectrum in both crystalline and amorphous GST can be assigned to vibrations of defective octahedra. The calculations reveal that the polarizability of the Sb-Te is much higher than that of Ge-Te bonds and of Ge-Ge/Sb wrong bonds resulting in a much lower Raman response of tetrahedra which are made of Ge-Te and wrong bonds. As a consequence and as opposed to amorphous GeTe, the signatures of tetrahedra in the Raman spectrum of amorphous GST are hidden by the larger Raman cross section of defective octahedra.},
