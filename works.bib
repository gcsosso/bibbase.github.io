The calculated spectra are in good agreement with experimental data which confirms the reliability of the models of the amorphous phase emerged from the simulations. All the features of the spectrum in both crystalline and amorphous GST can be assigned to vibrations of defective octahedra. The calculations reveal that the polarizability of the Sb-Te is much higher than that of Ge-Te bonds and of Ge-Ge/Sb wrong bonds resulting in a much lower Raman response of tetrahedra which are made of Ge-Te and wrong bonds. As a consequence and as opposed to amorphous GeTe, the signatures of tetrahedra in the Raman spectrum of amorphous GST are hidden by the larger Raman cross section of defective octahedra.},

It turns out that the majority of heat carriers are nonpropagating vibrations (diffusons), the small percentage of propagating modes giving a negligible contribution to the total value of κ. This result is in contrast with the properties of other amorphous semiconductors such as Si for which nonpropagating and propagating vibrations account for about one half of the value of κ each. This outcome suggests that the value of κ measured for the bulk amorphous phase can be used to model the thermal transport of GeTe and possibly of other materials in the same class also in nanoscaled memory devices.

The fast crystallization has been ascribed to the persistence of a high atomic mobility in the supercooled liquid phase, down to temperatures close to the glass transition. In this work we unravel the atomistic, structural origin of this feature in the supercooled liquid state of GeTe, a prototypical phase change compound, by means of molecular dynamic simulations. To this end, we employed an interatomic potential based on a neural network framework, which allows simulating thousands of atoms for tens of ns by keeping an accuracy close to that of the underlying first-principles framework. Our findings demonstrate that the high atomic mobility is related to the presence of clusters of slow and fast moving atoms. The latter contain a large fraction of chains of homopolar Ge?Ge bonds, which at low temperatures have a tendency to move by discontinuous cage-jump rearrangements. This structural fingerprint of dynamical heterogeneity provides an explanation of the breakdown of the Stokes?Einstein relation in GeTe, which is the ultimate origin of the fast crystallization of phase change materials exploited in the devices.},

	abstract = {Abstractauthoren Phase change memories rest on the ability of some chalcogenide alloys to undergo a fast and reversible transition between the crystalline and amorphous phases upon Joule heating. The fast crystallization is due to a high nucleation rate and a large crystal growth velocity which are actually possible thanks to the fragility of the supercooled liquid that allows for the persistence of a high atomic mobility at high supercooling where the thermodynamical driving force for crystallization is also high. Since crystallization in the devices occurs by rapidly heating the amorphous phase, hysteretic effects might arise with a different diffusion coefficient and viscosity on heating than on cooling. In this work, we have quantified these hysteretic effects in the phase change compound GeTe by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The atomic mobility in the overheated amorphous phase is lower than in supercooled liquid at the same temperature and the viscosity is consequently higher. Still, the simulations of the overheated amorphous phase reveal a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity, similarly to what we found previously in the supercooled liquid. Evidences are provided that the breakdown is due to the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities at high supercooling.},

	abstract = {What makes a material a good ice nucleating agent? Despite the importance of heterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to microbiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still prevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the ability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a function of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation rates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal, varying the water?surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It turns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice, customarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice nucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other hand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity can significantly alter the ice nucleation rate and can also lead to the formation of up to three different faces of ice on the same substrate. We have pinpointed three circumstances where heterogeneous ice nucleation can be promoted by the crystalline surface: (i) the formation of a water overlayer that acts as an in-plane template; (ii) the emergence of a contact layer buckled in an ice-like manner; and (iii) nucleation on compact surfaces with very high interaction strength. We hope that this extensive systematic study will foster future experimental work aimed at testing the physiochemical understanding presented herein.},

	abstract = {The formation of ice affects many aspects of our everyday life as well as important technologies such as cryotherapy and cryopreservation. Foreign substances almost always aid water freezing through heterogeneous ice nucleation, but the molecular details of this process remain largely unknown. In fact, insight into the microscopic mechanism of ice formation on different substrates is difficult to obtain even if state-of-the-art experimental techniques are used. At the same time, atomistic simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation frequently face extraordinary challenges due to the complexity of the water-substrate interaction and the long time scales that characterize nucleation events. Here, we have investigated several aspects of molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation considering as a prototypical ice nucleating material the clay mineral kaolinite, which is of relevance in atmospheric science. We show via seeded molecular dynamics simulations that ice nucleation on the hydroxylated (001) face of kaolinite proceeds exclusively via the formation of the hexagonal ice polytype. The critical nucleus size is two times smaller than that obtained for homogeneous nucleation at the same supercooling. Previous findings suggested that the flexibility of the kaolinite surface can alter the time scale for ice nucleation within molecular dynamics simulations. However, we here demonstrate that equally flexible (or non flexible) kaolinite surfaces can lead to very different outcomes in terms of ice formation, according to whether or not the surface relaxation of the clay is taken into account. We show that very small structural changes upon relaxation dramatically alter the ability of kaolinite to provide a template for the formation of a hexagonal overlayer of water molecules at the water-kaolinite interface, and that this relaxation therefore determines the nucleation ability of this mineral.},

Further, for measured values of the holes concentration and electrical conductivity, the electron-phonon term is larger than the contribution from the lattice.

By means of combined molecular dynamics and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory, we have unraveled the atomistic origin of the resistance drift in the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. The drift results from a widening of the band gap and a reduction of Urbach tails due to structural relaxations leading to the removal of chains of Ge-Ge homopolar bonds.

In this work, we have investigated by means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations the crystal growth of the prototypical phase change compound GeTe at the interface between the crystalline and the supercooled liquid reached in the device upon heating the amorphous phase. A neural network interatomic potential, markedly faster with respect to first-principles methods, allowed us to consider high-symmetry crystalline surfaces as well as polycrystalline models that are very close to the actual geometry of the memory devices. We have found that the crystal growth from the interface is dominant at high temperatures while it is competing with homogeneous crystallization in the melt at lower temperatures. The crystal growth velocity markedly depends on the crystallographic plane exposed at the interface, the (100) surface being kinetically dominant with respect to the (111) surface.

	abstract = {The Ge2Sb2Te5 compound is of interest for applications in phase change non-volatile memories. First-principles calculations of phonon dispersion relations and electron–phonon coupling constant provide an estimate of the electron–phonon contribution to the thermal boundary resistance at the interfaces of Ge2Sb2Te5 with dielectrics (silica) and metal electrodes (Al and TiN). The diffuse mismatch model including full phononic dispersion has been used to compute the phononic contribution to the thermal boundary resistance. The calculated value of the electron–phonon contribution to the TBR at 300 K of about 14 m2K GW−1 would dominate the TBR at the interfaces of hexagonal Ge2Sb2Te5 with the surrounding dielectrics and metals considered here once interdiffusion at the boundaries could be minimized.},

These applications rest on an ensemble of functional properties: a fast and reversible transformation between the amorphous and the crystalline phase upon heating and a strong optical and electronic contrast between the two phases that allow discriminating the two states of the memory. We discuss the insights gained from atomistic simulations based on Density Functional Theory on the functional properties of the prototypical phase change compounds Ge 2\_2 Sb 2\_2 Te 5\_5 and GeTe. We review the results on the structural and bonding properties of the crystalline and amorphous phases, the origin of the optical and electronic contrast between the two phases and the source of the fast crystallization of the supercooled liquid. The results on the crystallization kinetics obtained from large scale simulations with interatomic potentials based on Neural Network methods are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Most ice in nature forms because of impurities which boost the exceedingly low nucleation rate of pure supercooled water. However, the microscopic details of ice nucleation on these substances remain largely unknown. Here, we have unraveled the molecular mechanism and the kinetics of ice formation on kaolinite, a clay mineral playing a key role in climate science. We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous freezing. The critical nucleus is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface. Kaolinite also promotes the exclusive nucleation of hexagonal ice, as opposed to homogeneous freezing where a mixture of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is observed.},

	abstract = {The nucleation of crystals in liquids is one of nature’s most ubiquitous phenomena, playing an important role in areas such as climate change and the production of drugs. As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.},

	abstract = {Density fluctuations in liquid water are at the heart of numerous phenomena associated with hydrophobic effects such as protein folding and the interaction between biomolecules. One of the most fundamental processes in this regard is the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water. The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies examine density fluctuations at the short length scale focusing exclusively on spherical cavities. In this work, we use both first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that density fluctuations in liquid water can deviate significantly from the canonical spherical shapes. We show that regions of empty space are frequently characterized by exotic, highly asymmetric shapes that can be quite delocalized over the hydrogen bond network. Interestingly, density fluctuations of these shapes are characterized by Gaussian statistics with larger fluctuations. An important consequence of this is that the work required to create non spherical cavities can be substantially smaller than that of spheres. This feature is also qualitatively captured by the Lum–Chandler–Weeks theory. The scaling behavior of the free energy as a function of the volume at short length scales is qualitatively different for the nonspherical entities. We also demonstrate that nonspherical density fluctuations are important for accommodating the hydrophobic amino acid alanine and are thus likely to have significant implications when it comes to solvating highly asymmetrical species such as alkanes, polymers, or biomolecules.},

	abstract = {The structural nature of high-density amorphous ice (HDA), which forms through low-temperature pressure-induced amorphization of the “ordinary” ice I, is heavily debated. Clarifying this question is important for understanding not only the complex condensed states of H2O but also in the wider context of pressure-induced amorphization processes, which are encountered across the entire materials spectrum. We first show that ammonium fluoride (NH4F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes a pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is not amorphous but NH4F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV. This collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In the case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a deviation from this mechanism, and we therefore classify HDA as a “derailed” state along the ice I to ice IV pathway.},

We show how this method can be used to define collective variables and how these collective variables can be used to enhance the sampling of nucleation events. We then show how this method can be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy. The semiconducting alloy example we discuss is particular challenging as multiple nucleation centers are formed. We show, however, that our algorithm is able to detect the grain boundaries in the resulting polycrystal.},

	abstract = {Non-bonded potentials are included in most force fields and therefore widely used in classical molecular dynamics simulations of materials and interfacial phenomena. It is commonplace to truncate these potentials for computational efficiency based on the assumption that errors are negligible for reasonable cutoffs or compensated for by adjusting other interaction parameters. Arising from a metadynamics study of the wetting transition of water on a solid substrate, we find that the influence of the cutoff is unexpectedly strong and can change the character of the wetting transition from continuous to first order by creating artificial metastable wetting states. Common cutoff corrections such as the use of a force switching function, a shifted potential, or a shifted force do not avoid this. Such a qualitative difference urges caution and suggests that using truncated non-bonded potentials can induce unphysical behavior that cannot be fully accounted for by adjusting other interaction parameters.},

This chapter presents the results of NN simulations on the properties of liquid and amorphous GeTe including thermal conductivity and the homogeneous and heterogeneous crystallization of the amorphous. Phase change materials (PCM), recently used extensively in non-volatile rewritable memory devices, undergo a stable, rapid and reversible transition between a crystalline and an amorphous atomic structure. The coefficients for the Arrhenius function were derived by fitting the simulation results to the experimental data for the crystallization velocity. PCM, and especially Ge-Sb-Te (GST) alloys are leading candidates for such an innovative generation of non-volatile memory.

Toward this end, we have performed large-scale atomistic simulations of ultrathin nanowires (9 nm in diameter) of the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. We made use of an interatomic potential generated by the neural network fitting of a large ab initio database to compute the thermal properties of the nanowires. By melting a portion of a nanowire, we investigated the velocity of recrystallization as a function of temperature. The simulations show that the melting temperature of the nanowire is about 100 K below the melting temperature of the bulk, which yields a reduction by about a factor of 2 of the maximum crystallization speed. Further, analysis of the structural properties of the amorphous phase of the nanowire suggests a possible origin of the reduction of the resistance drift observed experimentally in nanowires with respect to the bulk.},
