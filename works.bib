Although the large broadening of the experimental Raman peaks prevents discriminating among the different stackings, the assignment of the Raman peaks to specific phonons is possible because the main features of the spectrum are rather insensitive to the actual distribution of atoms in the Sb/Ge sublattices. On the basis of the energetics (including configurational entropy) two stackings seem plausible candidates for GST, but only the mixed stacking by Matsunaga et al reproduces the spread of Ge/Sb–Te bond lengths measured experimentally.},

The calculated spectra are in good agreement with experimental data which confirms the reliability of the models of the amorphous phase emerged from the simulations. All the features of the spectrum in both crystalline and amorphous GST can be assigned to vibrations of defective octahedra. The calculations reveal that the polarizability of the Sb-Te is much higher than that of Ge-Te bonds and of Ge-Ge/Sb wrong bonds resulting in a much lower Raman response of tetrahedra which are made of Ge-Te and wrong bonds. As a consequence and as opposed to amorphous GeTe, the signatures of tetrahedra in the Raman spectrum of amorphous GST are hidden by the larger Raman cross section of defective octahedra.},

GeTe is a phase change material of interest for applications in nonvolatile memories. An interatomic potential with close-to-ab initio accuracy was used as generated by fitting a huge ab initio database with a neural network method. It turns out that the majority of heat carriers are nonpropagating vibrations (diffusons), the small percentage of propagating modes giving a negligible contribution to the total value of κ. This result is in contrast with the properties of other amorphous semiconductors such as Si for which nonpropagating and propagating vibrations account for about one half of the value of κ each. This outcome suggests that the value of κ measured for the bulk amorphous phase can be used to model the thermal transport of GeTe and possibly of other materials in the same class also in nanoscaled memory devices. Actually, the contribution from propagating modes, which may endure ballistic transport at the scale of 10–20 nm, is negligible.},

In this work, we investigate the microscopic origin of the fast crystallization process by means of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the phase change compound GeTe. To this end, we use an interatomic potential generated from a Neural Network fitting of a large database of ab initio energies. We demonstrate that in the temperature range of the programming protocols of the electronic memories (500?700 K), nucleation of the crystal in the supercooled liquid is not rate-limiting. In this temperature range, the growth of supercritical nuclei is very fast because of a large atomic mobility, which is, in turn, the consequence of the high fragility of the supercooled liquid and the associated breakdown of the Stokes?Einstein relation between viscosity and diffusivity.},

We find that Ice 0 is structurally similar to the supercooled liquid, and that on growth it gradually converts into a stacking of Ice Ic and Ih. We suggest that this mechanism provides a thermodynamic explanation for the location and pressure dependence of the homogeneous nucleation temperature, and that Ice 0 controls the homogeneous nucleation of low-pressure ices, acting as a precursor to crystallization in accordance with Ostwald’s step rule of phases. Our findings show that metastable crystalline phases of water may play roles that have been largely overlooked.},

	abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value—the so-called critical nucleus—they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor () that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {A small subset of the atmospheric aerosol population has the ability to induce ice formation at conditions under which ice would not form without them (heterogeneous ice nucleation). While no closed theoretical description of this process and the requirements for good ice nuclei is available, numerous studies have attempted to quantify the ice nucleation ability of different particles empirically in laboratory experiments. In this article, an overview of these results is provided. Ice nucleation onset conditions for various mineral dust, soot, biological, organic and ammonium sulphate particles are summarized. Typical temperature-supersaturation regions can be identified for the onset of ice nucleation of these different particle types, but the various particle sizes and activated fractions reported in different studies have to be taken into account when comparing results obtained with different methodologies. When intercomparing only data obtained under the same conditions, it is found that dust mineralogy is not a consistent predictor of higher or lower ice nucleation ability. However, the broad majority of studies agrees on a reduction of deposition nucleation by various coatings on mineral dust. The ice nucleation active surface site (INAS) density is discussed as a normalized measure for ice nucleation activity. For most immersion and condensation freezing measurements on mineral dust, estimates of the temperature-dependent INAS density agree within about two orders of magnitude. For deposition nucleation on dust, the spread is significantly larger, but a general trend of increasing INAS densities with increasing supersaturation is found. For soot, the presently available results are divergent. Estimated average INAS densities are high for ice-nucleation active bacteria at high subzero temperatures. At the same time, it is shown that some other biological aerosols, like certain pollen grains and fungal spores, are not intrinsically better ice nuclei than dust, but owe their high ice nucleation onsets to their large sizes. Surface-area-dependent parameterizations of heterogeneous ice nucleation are discussed. For immersion freezing on mineral dust, fitted INAS densities are available, but should not be used outside the temperature interval of the data they were based on. Classical nucleation theory, if employed with one fitted contact angle, does not reproduce the observed temperature dependence for immersion nucleation, temperature and supersaturation dependence for deposition nucleation, and time dependence.},

At moderate supercooling, a nucleation picture applies, while for deeper quenches, the phenomenon progressively acquires a spinodal character. We show that in the nucleation regime, the freezing is a two-step process. The formation of the critical nucleus is indeed preceded by the abrupt formation of a precritical crystallite from a density fluctuation in the fluid. In contrast, as the degree of supercooling is increased, crystallization proceeds in a more continuous and collective fashion and becomes more spatially diffuse, indicating that the liquid is unstable and crystallizes by a spinodal mechanism.},

	abstract = {The formation of ice particles in the Earth's atmosphere strongly affects the properties of clouds and their impact on climate. Despite the importance of ice formation in determining the properties of clouds, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) was unable to assess the impact of atmospheric ice formation in their most recent report because our basic knowledge is insufficient. Part of the problem is the paucity of quantitative information on the ability of various atmospheric aerosol species to initiate ice formation. Here we review and assess the existing quantitative knowledge of ice nucleation by particles immersed within supercooled water droplets. We introduce aerosol species which have been identified in the past as potentially important ice nuclei and address their ice-nucleating ability when immersed in a supercooled droplet. We focus on mineral dusts, biological species (pollen, bacteria, fungal spores and plankton), carbonaceous combustion products and volcanic ash. In order to make a quantitative comparison we first introduce several ways of describing ice nucleation and then summarise the existing information according to the time-independent (singular) approximation. Using this approximation in combination with typical atmospheric loadings, we estimate the importance of ice nucleation by different aerosol types. According to these estimates we find that ice nucleation below about −15 °C is dominated by soot and mineral dusts. Above this temperature the only materials known to nucleate ice are biological, with quantitative data for other materials absent from the literature. We conclude with a summary of the challenges our community faces.},

The calculated ice nucleation rates display a strong temperature dependence, ranging from 2.148 ± 0.635 × 1025 m−3 s−1 at 220 K to 1.672 ± 0.970 × 10−7 m−3 s−1 at 240 K. These rates can be fitted according to the classical nucleation theory, yielding an estimate of the effective ice–water interface energy γls of 31.01 ± 0.21 mJ m−2 for the mW water model. Compared to experiments, our calculation underestimates the homogeneous ice nucleation rate by a few orders of magnitude. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. The nucleating ice embryo contains both cubic ice Ic and hexagonal ice Ih, with the fraction of each structure being roughly 50\% when the critical size is reached. In particular, a novel defect structure containing nearly five-fold twin boundaries is identified in the ice clusters formed during nucleation. The way such defect structure is formed is found to be different from mechanisms proposed for the formation of the same defect in metallic nanoparticles and thin film. The quasi five-fold twin boundary structure found here is expected to occur in the crystallization of a wide range of materials with the diamond cubic structure, including ice.},

No assumptions are made about the distribution of paths at the interfaces. The three methods differ in the way that the transition path ensemble is generated. We apply the algorithms to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a genetic switch and to Langevin dynamics simulations of intermittently driven polymer translocation through a pore.

The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition states or reaction coordinates, as long as collective variables are known that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space. We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary metadynamics. We apply the formalism to three different problems and in each case find excellent agreement with the results of long unbiased molecular dynamics runs.},

	abstract = {One of water/'s unsolved puzzles is the question of what determines the lowest temperature to which it can be cooled before freezing to ice. The supercooled liquid has been probed experimentally to near the homogeneous nucleation temperature, TH [ap] 232 K, yet the mechanism of ice crystallization—including the size and structure of critical nuclei—has not yet been resolved. The heat capacity and compressibility of liquid water anomalously increase on moving into the supercooled region, according to power laws that would diverge (that is, approach infinity) at [sim]225 K (refs 1, 2), so there may be a link between water/'s thermodynamic anomalies and the crystallization rate of ice. But probing this link is challenging because fast crystallization prevents experimental studies of the liquid below TH. And although atomistic studies have captured water crystallization, high computational costs have so far prevented an assessment of the rates and mechanism involved. Here we report coarse-grained molecular simulations with the mW water model in the supercooled regime around TH which reveal that a sharp increase in the fraction of four-coordinated molecules in supercooled liquid water explains its anomalous thermodynamics and also controls the rate and mechanisms of ice formation. The results of the simulations and classical nucleation theory using experimental data suggest that the crystallization rate of water reaches a maximum around 225 K, below which ice nuclei form faster than liquid water can equilibrate. This implies a lower limit of metastability of liquid water just below TH and well above its glass transition temperature, 136 K. By establishing a relationship between the structural transformation in liquid water and its anomalous thermodynamics and crystallization rate, our findings also provide mechanistic insight into the observed dependence of homogeneous ice nucleation rates on the thermodynamics of water.},

However, over the last few years there have been important quantitative experiments at constant supersaturation, and the modelling of this data has also advanced. Experiments in which the supersaturation is varying, e.g., those at constant cooling rate, are important but hard to interpret. This review focuses on the state of the art in quantitative studies of nucleation at constant supersaturation. We can now test reliably for heterogeneous nucleation and somewhat less reliably for the rarer case of homogeneous nucleation. In the case of heterogeneous nucleation, we can also obtain at least some information on what is responsible for nucleation. We also now have (unfortunately currently untested) predictions for the scaling of nucleation timescales with system size. These predictions may prove important both for scaling up from small droplets to larger volumes, and for scaling down to crystallisation at the nanoscales relevant for nanotechnology applications. Finally, it is worth noting that in many experiments the dynamic range of nucleation times is too large to be measured. This is presumably due to highly variable impurities, and this problem may need to be addressed in future work.},

	abstract = {The addition of small 'seed' particles to a supersaturated solution can greatly increase the rate at which crystals nucleate. This process is understood, at least qualitatively, when the seed has the same structure as the crystal that it spawns. However, the microscopic mechanism of seeding by a 'foreign' substance is not well understood. Here we report numerical simulations of colloidal crystallization seeded by foreign objects. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to study how smooth spherical seeds of various sizes affect crystallization in a suspension of hard colloidal particles. We compute the free-energy barrier associated with crystal nucleation. A low barrier implies that nucleation is easy. We find that to be effective crystallization promoters, the seed particles need to exceed a well-defined minimum size. Just above this size, seed particles act as crystallization 'catalysts' as newly formed crystallites detach from the seed. In contrast, larger seed particles remain covered by the crystallites that they spawn. This phenomenon should be experimentally observable and can have important consequences for the control of the resulting crystal size distribution.},

Our observation that nucleation in grooves dominates that on flat surfaces not only explains the effectiveness of scratching a surface to induce crystallization but also allows us to see the microscopic behavior that underlies this common technique.

Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that an electric field, which acts very near a surface, can create an effective ice nucleus in models of supercooled liquid water. To serve as an ice nucleus, the field must polarize only a very thin water layer (?10 Å), and the field strength required is realistic on the relevant length scale. Our results support the idea that local electric fields could play a major role in heterogeneous ice nucleation, particularly for the very rough particles with many surface structure variations, that serve as ice nuclei in environmentally realistic situations.},

Laboratory studies suggest that some mineral dusts and primary biological particles—such as bacteria, pollen and fungi—can act as ice nuclei. Here we use aircraft-aerosol time-of-flight spectrometry to directly measure the chemistry of individual cloud ice-crystal residues (obtained after evaporation of the ice), which were sampled at high altitude over Wyoming. We show that biological particles and mineral dust comprised most of the ice-crystal residues: mineral dust accounted for 50\% of the residues and biological particles for 33\%. Along with concurrent measurements of cloud ice-crystal and ice-nuclei concentrations, these observations suggest that certain biological and dust particles initiated ice formation in the sampled clouds. Finally, we use a global aerosol model to show long-range transport of desert dust, suggesting that biological particles can enhance the impact of desert dust storms on the formation of cloud ice.},

	abstract = {Clouds composed of both ice particles and supercooled liquid water droplets exist at temperatures above {\textasciitilde}236 K. These mixed phase clouds, which strongly impact climate, are very sensitive to the presence of solid particles that can catalyse freezing. In this paper we describe experiments to determine the conditions at which the clay mineral kaolinite nucleates ice when immersed within water droplets. These are the first immersion mode experiments in which the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite has been determined as a function of clay surface area, cooling rate and also at constant temperatures. Water droplets containing a known amount of clay mineral were supported on a hydrophobic surface and cooled at rates of between 0.8 and 10 K min−1 or held at constant sub-zero temperatures. The time and temperature at which individual 10–50 μm diameter droplets froze were determined by optical microscopy. For a cooling rate of 10 K min−1, the median nucleation temperature of 10–40 μm diameter droplets increased from close to the homogeneous nucleation limit (236 K) to 240.8 ± 0.6 K as the concentration of kaolinite in the droplets was increased from 0.005 wt\% to 1 wt\%. This data shows that the probability of freezing scales with surface area of the kaolinite inclusions. We also show that at a constant temperature the number of liquid droplets decreases exponentially as they freeze over time. The constant cooling rate experiments are consistent with the stochastic, singular and modified singular descriptions of heterogeneous nucleation; however, freezing during cooling and at constant temperature can be reconciled best with the stochastic approach. We report temperature dependent nucleation rate coefficients (nucleation events per unit time per unit area) for kaolinite and present a general parameterisation for immersion nucleation which may be suitable for cloud modelling once nucleation by other important ice nucleating species is quantified in the future.},

	abstract = {Ice clouds in the tropical tropopause layer play a key role in dehydrating air as it enters the stratosphere. However, in situ measurements show that water vapour within these clouds is unexpectedly supersaturated; normally the growth of ice crystals rapidly quenches supersaturation. The high in-cloud humidity may be related to the low number of ice crystals found in these clouds, but low ice number densities are inconsistent with standard models of cirrus cloud formation involving homogeneous freezing of liquid aerosols. Aqueous aerosols rich in organic matter are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, and under cirrus conditions they are known to become glassy, that is, amorphous, non-crystalline solids. Here we report experiments in a cloud simulation chamber that demonstrate heterogeneous nucleation of ice on glassy solution droplets. Cirrus residues measured in situ showed ice nuclei rich in oxidized organic matter, consistent with heterogeneous nucleation on glassy aerosols. In addition, using a one-dimensional cirrus model, we show that nucleation on glassy aerosols may explain low ice crystal numbers and high in-cloud humidity in the tropical tropopause layer. We propose that heterogeneous nucleation on glassy aerosols is an important mechanism for ice nucleation in the tropical tropopause layer.},

Atmospheric aerosols also initiate ice formation in warmer, mixed-phase clouds, where ice crystals coexist with aqueous droplets. Biogenic aerosol particles of terrestrial origin, including bacteria and pollen, can act as ice nuclei. Whether biogenic particles of marine origin also act as ice nuclei has remained uncertain. We exposed the cosmopolitan planktonic diatom species Thalassiosira pseudonana to water vapour and supercooled aqueous sodium chloride under typical tropospheric conditions conducive to cirrus-cloud formation. Ice nucleation was determined using a controlled vapour cooling-stage microscope system. Under all conditions, diatoms initiated ice formation. The presence of diatoms in water increased the temperature for ice formation up to 13 K, and in aqueous sodium chloride, ice formed at temperatures up to 30 K higher than when diatoms were not present. In addition, diatoms initiated ice formation from water vapour at relative humidities as low as 65\%. The rate of ice nucleation was rapid and independent of surface area. We suggest that marine biogenic particles such as diatoms help explain high values and seasonal variations in ice-nuclei concentrations in subpolar regions.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous ice nucleation experiments have been performed with four different ice nuclei (IN), namely nonadecanol, silica, silver iodide and Arizona test dust. All IN are either immersed in the droplets or located at the droplets surface. The IN were exposed to various aqueous solutions, which consist of (NH4)2SO4, H2SO4, MgCl2, NaCl, LiCl, Ca(NO3)2, K2CO3, CH3COONa, ethylene glycol, glycerol, malonic acid, PEG300 or a NaCl/malonic acid mixture. Freezing was studied using a differential scanning calorimeter and a cold finger cell. The results show that the heterogeneous ice freezing temperatures decrease with increasing solute concentration; however, the magnitude of this effect is solute dependent. In contrast, when the results are analyzed in terms of the solution water activity a very consistent behavior emerges:? heterogeneous ice nucleation temperatures for all four IN converge each onto a single line, irrespective of the nature of the solute. We find that a constant offset with respect to the ice melting point curve, ?aw,het, can describe the observed freezing temperatures for each IN. Such a behavior is well-known for homogeneous ice nucleation from supercooled liquid droplets and has led to the development of water-activity-based ice nucleation theory. The large variety of investigated solutes together with different general types of ice nuclei studied (monolayers, ionic crystals, covalently bound network-forming compounds, and a mixture of chemically different crystallites) underlines the general applicability of water-activity-based ice nucleation theory also for heterogeneous ice nucleation in the immersion mode. Finally, the ice nucleation efficiencies of the various IN, as well as the atmospheric implication of the developed parametrization are discussed.},

We emphasize studies of low (submonolayer) coverages of water on well-characterized, single-crystal surfaces of metals, semiconductors and oxides. We discuss the factors which influence dissociative versus associative adsorption pathways. When H2O adsorbs molecularly, it tends to form three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded clusters, even at fractional monolayer coverages, because the strength of the attractive interaction between two molecules is comparable to that of the substrate-H2O bond. The template effect of the substrate is important in determining both the local orientation and long-range order of H2O molecules in these clusters. The influence of surface additive atoms (e.g., O, Br, Na, K) and also surface imperfections (e.g. steps and defects) on the surface structure and chemistry of H2O is examined in detail. Some results on single-crystal substrates are compared with earlier measurements of H2O adsorption on high-area materials.},

	abstract = {Water is perhaps the most important and most pervasive chemical on our planet. The influence of water permeates virtually all areas of biochemical, chemical and physical importance, and is especially evident in phenomena occurring at the interfaces of solid surfaces. Since 1987, when Thiel and Madey (TM) published their review titled ‘The interaction of water with solid surfaces: fundamental aspects’ in Surface Science Reports, there has been considerable progress made in further understanding the fundamental interactions of water with solid surfaces. In the decade and a half, the increased capability of surface scientists to probe at the molecular-level has resulted in more detailed information of the properties of water on progressively more complicated materials and under more stringent conditions. This progress in understanding the properties of water on solid surfaces is evident both in areas for which surface science methodology has traditionally been strong (catalysis and electronic materials) and also in new areas not traditionally studied by surface scientists such as electrochemistry, photoconversion, mineralogy, adhesion, sensors, atmospheric chemistry and tribology. Researchers in all these fields grapple with very basic questions regarding the interactions of water with solid surfaces such as how is water adsorbed, what are the chemical and electrostatic forces that constitute the adsorbed layer, how is water thermally or non-thermally activated and how do coadsorbates influence these properties of water. The attention paid to these and other fundamental questions in the past decade and a half has been immense. In this review, experimental studies published since the TM review are assimilated with those covered by TM to provide a current picture of the fundamental interactions of water with solid surfaces.},

	abstract = {Water adsorption at metal surfaces is governed by a subtle balance between water–water hydrogen bonding and water–metal interactions, which together determine the stability of the water structures formed. This review describes recent experimental and theoretical studies of water and OH/water coadsorption on well-defined single crystal metal surfaces, systems that have seen an upsurge in interest as new results modify our picture of how water adsorbs on metal surfaces. These results reveal that the simple, conventional ice ‘bilayer’ description of water adsorption, in which water is only marginally distorted from its bulk ice arrangement, is inadequate to describe wetting. Instead, optimisation of the water–metal interaction distorts the local hydrogen bonding geometry of water monolayers significantly from that of bulk ice, with consequent effects on the lateral size and geometry of ice clusters, on the structure of water monolayers and on the wetting of first layer water and growth of ice multilayers. Here we compare adsorption across different metal surfaces, review evidence for the formation of mixed OH/H2O co-adsorption structures and highlight issues that remain uncertain.},

Here we show, through a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and density-functional theory, that about 1-nm-wide ice chains that nucleate on Cu(110) are not built from hexagons, but instead are built from a face-sharing arrangement of water pentagons. The pentagon structure is favoured over others because it maximizes the water–metal bonding while maintaining a strong hydrogen-bonding network. It reveals an unanticipated structural adaptability of water–ice films, demonstrating that the presence of the substrate can be sufficient to favour non-hexagonal structural units.},

Water monomers at low coverage, water clusters, water bilayers and water multilayers have all been examined. The most important and interesting results from this study are: (i) water monomers bind strongly to kaolinite compared to many other substrates. In the preferred adsorption structure water accepts two H bonds from and donates one H bond to the substrate, revealing that kaolinite, like water, is amphoteric with the ability to accept and donate H bonds; (ii) clustering of adsorbed water molecules is not significantly favored. All water clusters (dimers, tetramers, and hexamers) examined are, at best, equally stable to water monomers; (iii) a 2D ice-like bilayer, with a stability matching that of ice Ih has been identified implying that water can wet kaolinite; (iv) multilayer ice growth is not favored, being considerably unstable compared to bulk ice, indicating that the water covered kaolinite surface is itself “hydrophobic”. Overall we see that amphoterism of the hydroxylated surface is key to many of the interesting properties of kaolinite with regard to water adsorption and ice nucleation, revealing that the behavior of water on kaolinite is more complex and interesting than previously thought to be and highlighting the need for further theoretical and experimental work.},

Indeed despite extensive studies into ice melting and premelting, little is known about the relationship between (pre)melting and crystal size and morphology, with, for example, the melting temperature of ice nanocrystals being unclear. Here we report extensive long-time force-field-based molecular dynamics studies of the melting of hexagonal ice nanocrystals in the ca. 2 to 8 nm size range. We show that premelting is initiated at the corners of the crystals, then the edges between facets, and then the flat surfaces; that is, the melting temperature is related to the degree of coordination. A strong size dependence of the melting temperature is observed, with the combination of small particle size and premelting leading nanosized ice crystals to have liquid-like surfaces as low as about 130 K below the bulk ice melting temperature. These results will be of relevance in understanding the size dependence of ice crystal morphology and the surface reactivity of ice particles under atmospheric conditions.},

Here we use molecular dynamics simulations with the mW water model to investigate the nonequilibrium freezing and equilibrium melting of water nanoparticles with radii R between 1 and 4.7 nm and the structure of the ice formed by crystallization at temperatures between 150 and 200 K. The ice crystallized in the particles is a hybrid form of ice I with stacked layers of the cubic and hexagonal ice polymorphs in a ratio approximately 2:1. The ratio of cubic ice to hexagonal ice is insensitive to the radius of the water particle and is comparable to that found in simulations of bulk water around the same temperature. Heating frozen particles that contain multiple crystallites leads to Ostwald ripening and annealing of the ice structures, accompanied by an increase in the amount of ice at the expense of the liquid water, before the particles finally melt from the hybrid ice I to liquid, without a transition to hexagonal ice. The melting temperatures Tm of the nanoparticles are not affected by the ratio of cubic to hexagonal layers in the crystal. Tm of the ice particles decreases from 255 to 170 K with the particle size and is well described by the Gibbs?Thomson equation, Tm(R) = Tmbulk ? KGT/(R???d), with constant KGT = 82 ± 5 K·nm and a premelted liquid of width d = 0.26 ± 0.05 nm, about one monolayer. The freezing temperatures also decrease with the particles? radii.

However, little is known at the microscopic level about which properties of a material determine its effectiveness at nucleating ice. This work focuses on the long standing, conceptually simple, view on the role of a good crystallographic match between bulk ice and the underlying substrate. We use grand canonical Monte Carlo to generate the first overlayer of water at the surface and find that the traditional view of heterogeneous nucleation does not adequately account for the array of structures that water may form at the surface. We find that, in order to describe the structures formed, a good match between the substrate and the nearest neighbour oxygen–oxygen distance is a better descriptor than a good match to the bulk ice lattice constant.},

Despite numerous experimental and computational studies, no consensus has been reached on the question of whether or not H3O+ and/or OH? prefer to be at the water surface or in the bulk. Here we report a molecular dynamics simulation study of the bulk vs interfacial behavior of H3O+ and OH? that employs forces derived from density functional theory with a generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional (specifically, BLYP) and empirical dispersion corrections. We computed the potential of mean force (PMF) for H3O+ as a function of the position of the ion in the vicinity of an air?water interface. The PMF suggests that H3O+ has equal propensity for the interface and the bulk. We compare the PMF for H3O+ to our previously computed PMF for OH? adsorption, which contains a shallow minimum at the interface, and we explore how differences in solvation of each ion at the interface vs in the bulk are connected with interfacial propensity. We find that the solvation shell of H3O+ is only slightly dependent on its position in the water slab, while OH? partially desolvates as it approaches the interface, and we examine how this difference in solvation behavior is manifested in the electronic structure and chemistry of the two ions.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate heterogeneous ice nucleation in model systems where an electric field acts on water molecules within 10?20 Å of a surface. Two different water models (the six-site and TIP4P/Ice models) are considered, and in both cases, it is shown that a surface field can serve as a very effective ice nucleation catalyst in supercooled water. Ice with a ferroelectric cubic structure nucleates near the surface, and dipole disordered cubic ice grows outward from the surface layer. We examine the influences of temperature and two important field parameters, the field strength and distance from the surface over which it acts, on the ice nucleation process. For the six-site model, the highest temperature where we observe field-induced ice nucleation is 280 K, and for TIP4P/Ice 270 K (note that the estimated normal freezing points of the six-site and TIP4P/Ice models are ?289 and ?270 K, respectively). The minimum electric field strength required to nucleate ice depends a little on how far the field extends from the surface. If it extends 20 Å, then a field strength of 1.5 ? 109 V/m is effective for both models. If the field extent is 10 Å, then stronger fields are required (2.5 ? 109 V/m for TIP4P/Ice and 3.5 ? 109 V/m for the six-site model). Our results demonstrate that fields of realistic strength, that act only over a narrow surface region, can effectively nucleate ice at temperatures not far below the freezing point. This further supports the possibility that local electric fields can be a significant factor influencing heterogeneous ice nucleation in physical situations. We would expect this to be especially relevant for ice nuclei with very rough surfaces where one would expect local fields of varying strength and direction.},

We report that positively charged surfaces of pyroelectric LiTaO3 crystals and SrTiO3 thin films promote ice nucleation, whereas the same surfaces when negatively charged reduce the freezing temperature. Accordingly, droplets of water cooled down on a negatively charged LiTaO3 surface and remaining liquid at –11°C freeze immediately when this surface is heated to –8°C, as a result of the replacement of the negative surface charge by a positive one. Furthermore, powder x-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the freezing on the positively charged surface starts at the solid/water interface, whereas on a negatively charged surface, ice nucleation starts at the air/water interface.},

	abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

We present here the analysis of the self intermediate scattering functions in a large range of temperatures and densities and we show that the structural relaxation in the region of mild supercooling is in agreement with the predictions of the mode coupling theory. In the more deep supercooled region we observe that the α-relaxation time deviates from the mode coupling theory (MCT) trend and a crossover takes place from a fragile to a strong behavior upon crossing the Widom line emanating from the LLCP.

We apply this to the benchmark case of a Lennard-Jones potential, and the results confirm the most reliable data obtained previously. We demonstrate several advantages of our approach: it is simple to implement, robust and free of hysteresis problems, it allows a rigorous and unbiased estimate of the statistical uncertainty, and it returns a good estimate of the thermodynamic limit with system sizes of a just a few hundred atoms. It is therefore attractive for applications which require more realistic and specific models of interatomic forces.},

The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K . This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties.

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions.

	abstract = {In experiments, the growth rate of ice from supercooled water is seen to increase with the degree of supercooling, that is, the lower the temperature, the faster the crystallization takes place. In molecular dynamics simulations of the freezing process, however, the temperature is usually kept constant by means of a thermostat that artificially removes the heat released during the crystallization by scaling the velocities of the particles. This direct removal of energy from the system replaces a more realistic heat-conduction mechanism and is believed to be responsible for the curious observation that the thermostatted icegrowth proceeds fastest near the melting point and more slowly at lower temperatures, which is exactly opposite to the experimental findings [M. A. Carignano, P. B. Shepson, and I. Szleifer, Mol. Phys.103, 2957 (2005)10.1080/00268970500243796]. This trend is explained by the diffusion and the reorientation of molecules in the liquid becoming the rate-determining steps for the crystal growth, both of which are slower at low temperatures. Yet, for a different set of simulations, a kinetic behavior analogous to the experimental finding has been reported [H. Nada and Y. Furukawa, J. Crystal Growth283, 242 (2005)10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2005.05.057]. To clarify this apparent contradiction, we perform relatively long simulations of the TIP4P/Ice model in an extended range of temperatures. The temperature dependence of the thermostatted icegrowth is seen to be more complex than was previously reported: The crystallization process is very slow close to the melting point at 270 K, where the thermodynamic driving force for the phase transition is weak. On lowering the temperature, the growth rate initially increases, but displays a maximum near 260 K. At even lower temperatures, the freezing process slows down again due to the reduced diffusivity in the liquid. The velocity of the thermostatted melting process, in contrast, shows a monotonic increase upon raising the temperature beyond the normal melting point. In this case, the effects of the increasing thermodynamic driving force and the faster diffusion at higher temperatures reinforce each other. In the context of this study, we also report data for the diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature for the water models TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005.},

Because primitive hydrophobic effects can be tied to the probability of observing a molecular-sized cavity in the solvent, the probability distribution of the number of solvent centers in a cavity volume is modeled on the basis of the two moments available from the density and radial distribution of oxygen atoms in liquid water. The modeled distribution then yields the probability that no solvent centers are found in the cavity volume. This model is shown to account quantitatively for the central hydrophobic phenomena of cavity formation and association of inert gas solutes. The connection of information theory to statistical thermodynamics provides a basis for clarification of hydrophobic effects. The simplicity and flexibility of the approach suggest that it should permit applications to conformational equilibria of nonpolar solutes and hydrophobic residues in biopolymers.},

It is not known which structural and chemical characteristics of soot account for the variability in ice nucleation efficiency. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the nucleation of ice from liquid water in contact with graphitic surfaces. We find that atomically flat carbon surfaces promote heterogeneous nucleation of ice, while molecularly rough surfaces with the same hydrophobicity do not. Graphitic surfaces and other surfaces that promote ice nucleation induce layering in the interfacial water, suggesting that the order imposed by the surface on liquid water may play an important role in the heterogeneous nucleation mechanism. We investigate a large set of graphitic surfaces of various dimensions and radii of curvature and find that variations in nanostructures alone could account for the spread in the freezing temperatures of ice on soot in experiments. We conclude that a characterization of the nanostructure of soot is needed to predict its ice nucleation efficiency.},

	abstract = {Rates of heterogeneous nucleation can be greatly increased not only through control of the chemistry of a surface, but also of its topography. Following previous work in which we showed that scratching a mica surface significantly enhances crystal nucleation from vapor, we here use a new experimental approach to understand better the effect of topography on crystal nucleation. The compounds carbon tetrabromide, camphor, norbornane, and hexachloroethane were deposited from vapor onto mica sheets containing various surface defects, and their nucleation was studied using optical microscopy. Following subsequent evaporation of the crystals, examination of the sites where these had nucleated with a scanning electron microscope enabled the nature of each material?s preferred nucleation sites to be determined, and all four compounds appeared to exhibit a strong preference for sites characterized by delamination of the layered mica structure. Indeed, comparison of the four compounds on the same mica substrates showed that they all favored the same nucleation sites. These observations are attributed to the presence of an acute wedge geometry at the delamination lines, which can provide a thermodynamic reduction in the free energy barrier to nucleation directly from vapor; alternatively, the results are also consistent with a two-step nucleation mechanism via a liquid capillary condensate.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous self-assembling, such as formation of molecular crystals, is a fascinating topic for investigation. Ability to initiate and control such transformations promises numerous benefits, but our knowledge of underlying mechanisms of such processes is rather limited. The process of freezing of water is an excellent testing ground for such studies. In this paper we report the results of a systematic molecular dynamics study of ice growth at three different temperatures below the melting point initiated from a number of initial interface structures within the isoconfigurational ensemble. It is shown that a specific structure at a growing ice–water interface is able to affect the growth process over a time scale of 1–2 ns. This structural effect can be characterized in terms of relative growth propensities. On the basis of the differences in the shape between isoconfigurational rate distributions and the rate distribution typical of the specific temperature several different kinds of relative growth propensities have been identified. The initial interfacial configurations employed in this work have been assigned using the proposed classification and possible mechanisms of propensity realization have been suggested for selected cases. Results reported in this paper clearly indicate that local structure effects can have significant impact on tendency for a particular ice surface to grow (or melt). The structural effect on ordering propensities is, most probably, a more universal behaviour and might be expected to be seen in other similar problems such as, for example, protein folding.},

We identify two distinct filling mechanisms, depending on whether the water?pore interaction is smaller or larger than the water?water interaction. In the former case (that we term hydrophobic pore), the formation of the condensed phase proceeds gradually with filling, through the nucleation of a water cluster which grows toward the center of the cavity. In hydrophilic pores, instead, the condensed phase develops in conditions of supersaturation, which in principle become more extreme with increasing pore radius and surface affinity. For highly hydrophilic interfaces (those with adsorption energy for water above 10 kcal/mol), the equilibrium and dynamical properties of water in confinement turn out to be practically independent of water affinity.},

Here we show that, on a rough surface, the shape of surface nanopores can also alter nucleation kinetics. Using lithographic methods, we patterned polymer films with nanopores of various shapes and found that spherical nanopores 15–120 nm in diameter hindered nucleation of aspirin crystals, whereas angular nanopores of the same size promoted it. We also show that favourable surface–solute interactions are required for angular nanopores to promote nucleation, and propose that pore shape affects nucleation kinetics through the alteration of the orientational order of the crystallizing molecule near the angles of the pores. Our findings have clear technological implications, for instance in the control of pharmaceutical polymorphism and in the design of ‘seed’ particles for the regulation of crystallization of fine chemicals.},

For purely repulsive solutes, the squared width of the interface increases linearly with the logarithm of the solute size, as predicted by capillary-wave theory. The apparent interfacial tension extracted from the slope agrees with that of a free liquid–vapor interface. The characteristic length of local density fluctuations is ≈0.5 nm, measured along the arc, again consistent with that of a free liquid–vapor interface. Probed locally, the interfacial density fluctuations exhibit large variances that exceed those expected for an ideal gas. Qualitatively consistent with theories of the free liquid–vapor interface, we find that the water interface near large and strongly nonpolar solutes is flickering, broadened by capillary-wave fluctuations. These fluctuations result in transitions between locally wet and dry regions that are slow on a molecular time scale.},

Ensuring though that these two criteria are met may not always be simple. Here we build on the fact that the times of escape from a long-lived metastable state obey Poisson statistics.

Our principal result is that the probability for density fluctuations of water near a hydrophobic surface, with or without surface water attractions, is akin to density fluctuations at the water-vapor interface. Specifically, the probability of density depletion near the surface is significantly larger than that in the bulk, and this enhanced probability is responsible for hydrophobic forces of assembly. In contrast, we find that the statistics of water density fluctuations near a model hydrophilic surface are similar to that in the bulk.},

AgI is one of the best ice nucleating agents known; however, why AgI is such an effective ice nucleus is unclear. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that a good lattice match between ice and a AgI surface is insufficient to predict the ice nucleation ability of the surface. Seven faces modeled to represent surfaces of both ?-AgI and ?-AgI, each having a good lattice match with hexagonal and/or cubic ice, are considered, but ice nucleation is observed for only three. Our model simulations clearly show that the detailed atomistic structure of the surface is of crucial importance for ice nucleation. For example, when AgI is cleaved along certain crystal planes two faces result, one with silver ions and the other with iodide ions exposed as the outermost layer. Both faces have identical lattice matches with ice, but in our simulations ice nucleation occurred only at silver exposed surfaces. Moreover, although hexagonal ice is often the only polymorph of ice considered in discussions of heterogeneous ice nucleation, cubic ice was frequently observed in our simulations. We demonstrate that one possible mechanism of ice nucleation by AgI consists of particular AgI surfaces imposing a structure in the adjacent water layer that closely resembles a layer that exists in bulk ice (hexagonal or cubic). Ice nucleates at these surfaces and grows almost layer-by-layer into the bulk.},

Antifreeze proteins minimize freezing damage by inhibiting growth of large ice crystals, while ice nucleation proteins induce formation of embryonic ice crystals. Although both protein classes have differing functions, these proteins use the same ice binding mechanisms. Rather than direct binding, it is probable that these protein classes create an ice surface prior to ice crystal surface adsorption. Function is differentiated by molecular size of the protein.

Further, we address the shortcomings of the thermodynamic theory in describing the nucleation and emphasize the importance of nanoscale effects. This leads to the description of condensation from a molecular viewpoint. Also presented is how the nucleation can be simulated by use of molecular models, and how the condensation process is simulated on the macroscale using computational fluid dynamics.

	abstract = {Abstract An ice nucleation parameterization based on classical nucleation theory, with aerosol-specific parameters derived from experiments, has been implemented into a global climate model—the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)-Oslo. The parameterization treats immersion, contact, and deposition nucleation by mineral dust, soot, bacteria, fungal spores, and pollen in mixed-phase clouds at temperatures between 0° and −38°C. Immersion freezing is considered for insoluble particles that are activated to cloud droplets, and deposition and contact nucleation are only allowed for uncoated, unactivated aerosols. Immersion freezing by mineral dust is found to be the dominant ice formation process, followed by immersion and contact freezing by soot. The simulated biological aerosol contribution to global atmospheric ice formation is marginal, even with high estimates of their ice nucleation activity, because the number concentration of ice nucleation active biological particles in the atmosphere is low compared to other ice nucleating aerosols. Because of the dominance of mineral dust, the simulated ice nuclei concentrations at temperatures below −20°C are found to correlate with coarse-mode aerosol particle concentrations. The ice nuclei (IN) concentrations in the model agree well overall with in situ continuous flow diffusion chamber measurements. At individual locations, the model exhibits a stronger temperature dependence on IN concentrations than what is observed. The simulated IN composition (77\% mineral dust, 23\% soot, and 10−5\% biological particles) lies in the range of observed ice nuclei and ice crystal residue compositions.},

In the present study, the role of primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) as heterogeneous ice nuclei is investigated with a global model. Emission parametrizations for bacteria, fungal spores and pollen based on recent literature are introduced, as well as an immersion freezing parametrization based on classical nucleation theory and laboratory measurements. The simulated contribution of PBAPs to the global average ice nucleation rate is only 10 − 5\%, with an uppermost estimate of 0.6\%. At the same time, observed PBAP concentrations in air and biological ice nucleus concentrations in snow are reasonably well captured by the model. This implies that 'bioprecipitation' processes (snow and rain initiated by PBAPs) are of minor importance on the global scale.},

	abstract = {Classical crystal growth models posit that crystallization outcomes are determined by nuclei that resemble mature crystal phases, but at a critical size where the volume free energy of nuclei begins to offset the unfavorable surface free energy arising from the interface with the growth medium. Crystallization under nanoscale confinement offers an opportunity to examine nucleation and phase transformations at length scales corresponding to the critical size, at which kinetics and thermodynamics of nucleation and growth intersect and dramatic departures in stability compared to bulk crystals can appear. This tutorial review focuses on recent investigations of the crystallization of organic compounds in nanoporous matrices that effectively provide millions of nanoscale reactors in a single sample, ranging from controlled porous glass (CPG) beads to nanoporous block-copolymer monoliths to anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. Confinement of crystal growth in this manner provides a snapshot of the earliest stages of crystal growth, with insights into nucleation, size-dependent polymorphism, and thermotropic behavior of nanoscale crystals. Moreover, these matrices can be used to screen for crystal polymorphs and assess their stability as nanocrystals. The well-aligned cylindrical nanoscale pores of polymer monoliths or AAO also allow determination of preferred orientation of embedded nanocrystals, affording insight into the competitive nature of nucleation, critical sizes, and phase transition mechanisms. Collectively, these investigations have increased our understanding of crystallization at length scales that are deterministic while suggesting strategies for controlling crystallization outcomes.},

At 1 atm pressure, the simulated guest-free water clathrates are metastable with respect to ice and stable with respect to the liquid up to their melting temperatures, 245 ± 2 and 252 ± 2 K for sI and sII, respectively. We characterize the growth of the sI and sII water crystals from supercooled water and find that the clathrates are unable to nucleate ice, the stable crystal. We computed the phase relations of ice, guest-free sII clathrate, and liquid water from ?1500 to 500 atm. The resulting phase diagram indicates that empty sII may be the stable phase of water at pressures lower than approximately ?1300 atm and temperatures lower than 275 K. The simulations show that, even in the region of stability of the empty clathrates, supercooled liquid water crystallizes to ice. This suggests that the barrier for nucleation of ice is lower than that for clathrates. We find no evidence for the existence of the characteristic polyhedral clathrate cages in supercooled extended water. Our results show that clathrates do not need the presence of a guest molecule to grow, but they need the guest to nucleate from liquid water. We conclude that nucleation of empty clathrates from supercooled liquid water would be extremely challenging if not impossible to attain in experiments. We propose two strategies to produce empty water clathrates in laboratory experiments at low positive pressures.},

We estimate the ice-liquid interfacial free-energy, and conclude that for all water models γ decreases as the temperature decreases. Extrapolating our results to the melting temperature, we obtain a value of the interfacial free-energy between 25 and 32 mN/m in reasonable agreement with the reported experimental values. Moreover, we observe that the values of γ depend on the chosen water model and this is a key factor when numerically evaluating nucleation rates, given that the kinetic prefactor is quite similar for all water models with the exception of the mW (due to the absence of hydrogens). Somewhat surprisingly the estimates of the nucleation rates found in this work for TIP4P/2005 are slightly higher than those of the mW model, even though the former has explicit hydrogens. Our results suggest that it may be possible to observe in computer simulations spontaneous crystallization of TIP4P/2005 at about 60 K below the melting point.},

However, over the last few years there have been important quantitative experiments at constant supersaturation, and the modelling of this data has also advanced. Experiments in which the supersaturation is varying, e.g., those at constant cooling rate, are important but hard to interpret. This review focuses on the state of the art in quantitative studies of nucleation at constant supersaturation. We can now test reliably for heterogeneous nucleation and somewhat less reliably for the rarer case of homogeneous nucleation. In the case of heterogeneous nucleation, we can also obtain at least some information on what is responsible for nucleation. We also now have (unfortunately currently untested) predictions for the scaling of nucleation timescales with system size. These predictions may prove important both for scaling up from small droplets to larger volumes, and for scaling down to crystallisation at the nanoscales relevant for nanotechnology applications. Finally, it is worth noting that in many experiments the dynamic range of nucleation times is too large to be measured. This is presumably due to highly variable impurities, and this problem may need to be addressed in future work.},

	abstract = {Aberrant crystallization within the human body can lead to several disease states, although traditionally the pathogenesis of such diseases has not been studied from a materials science perspective. A fundamental understanding of the nucleation and growth, sometimes followed by aggregation and adhesion of crystals to tissue, is essential for the elucidation of the mechanisms directing the pathogenesis of these diseases. The quest for a greater understanding of these in vivo events has prompted the use of innovative experimental approaches aimed at understanding them at a microscopic level, often under conditions thought to emulate a physiological environment. Real-time, in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to elucidate the effect of urinary substituents on calcium-containing crystals that aggregate to form kidney stones, demonstrating the role of anionic proteins, synthetic polymers and small molecules on crystal growth regulation. Through an understanding of the structure of l-cystine crystals, which produce a rare and severe form of kidney stones, intermolecular interactions necessary for the growth of these crystals were identified and molecular inhibitors were designed that bind stereospecifically to actively growing crystal faces, thereby suppressing growth. X-ray diffraction techniques have been used to investigate the nucleation of cholesterol crystals within lipid membranes, providing insight into the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and crystals that can aggregate to form gallstones. The discovery of the crystal structure of hemozoin, which results from the crystallization of free heme within the digestive vacuole of the prevalent malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, combined with grazing angle X-ray diffraction and other methods, has informed on the mode of action of common antimalarial drugs, providing guidance for the development of new therapies that can overcome the increasing resistance of the parasite to current drugs. The role of materials science in the study of pathological conditions is expected to become increasingly significant as crystal growth theory, solid-state chemistry, and materials characterization methods are applied to a greater breadth of disorders, ranging from crystalline amyloid proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases to unwanted in vivo crystallization of administered pharmacological compounds.},

The crystalline state often shows an octahedral-like atomic arrangement, frequently accompanied by pronounced lattice distortions and huge vacancy concentrations. This can be attributed to the chemical bonding in phase-change alloys, which is promoted by p-orbitals. From this insight, phase-change alloys with desired properties can be designed. This is demonstrated for the optical properties of phase-change alloys, in particular the contrast between the amorphous and crystalline states.

Chem. 103, 4570–4577] is applied to treat the temperature dependence of hydrophobic solvation in water. The application illustrates how the temperature dependence for hydrophobic surfaces extending less than 1 nm differs significantly from that for surfaces extending more than 1 nm. The latter is the result of water depletion, a collective effect, that appears at length scales of 1 nm and larger. Because of the contrasting behaviors at small and large length scales, hydrophobicity by itself can explain the variable behavior of entropies of protein folding.},

	abstract = {Hydrophobicity is often characterized macroscopically by the droplet contact angle. Molecular signatures of hydrophobicity have, however, remained elusive. Successful theories predict a drying transition leading to a vapor-like region near large hard-sphere solutes and interfaces. Adding attractions wets the interface with local density increasing with attractions. Here we present extensive molecular simulation studies of hydration of realistic surfaces with a wide range of chemistries from hydrophobic (−CF3, −CH3) to hydrophilic (−OH, −CONH2). We show that the water density near weakly attractive hydrophobic surfaces (e.g., −CF3) can be bulk-like or larger, and provides a poor quantification of surface hydrophobicity. In contrast, the probability of cavity formation or the free energy of binding of hydrophobic solutes to interfaces correlates quantitatively with the macroscopic wetting properties and serves as an excellent signature of hydrophobicity. Specifically, the probability of cavity formation is enhanced in the vicinity of hydrophobic surfaces, and water–water correlations correspondingly display characteristics similar to those near a vapor–liquid interface. Hydrophilic surfaces suppress cavity formation and reduce the water–water correlation length. Our results suggest a potentially robust approach for characterizing hydrophobicity of more complex and heterogeneous surfaces of proteins and biomolecules, and other nanoscopic objects.},

The calculated solvent atomic density in contact with these cavities shows that water applies more force per unit area of cavity surface than do the hydrocarbon liquids. This contact density, or “squeezing” force, reaches a maximum near cavity diameters of 2.4 Å. The results for liquid water are compared to the predictions of simple theories and, in addition, to results for a reference simple liquid. The numerical data for water at a range of temperatures are analyzed to extract a surface free energy contribution to the work of formation of atomic-size cavities. Comparison with the liquid-vapor interfacial tensions of the model liquids studies here indicates that the surface free energies extracted for atomic-size cavities cannot be accurately identified with the macroscopic surface tensions of the systems.},

	abstract = {A contending technology for nonvolatile memories of the next generation is based on a remarkable property of chalcogenide alloys known as phase change materials, namely their ability to undergo a fast and reversible transition between the amorphous and crystalline phases upon heating. The fast crystallization has been ascribed to the persistence of a high atomic mobility in the supercooled liquid phase, down to temperatures close to the glass transition. In this work we unravel the atomistic, structural origin of this feature in the supercooled liquid state of GeTe, a prototypical phase change compound, by means of molecular dynamic simulations. To this end, we employed an interatomic potential based on a neural network framework, which allows simulating thousands of atoms for tens of ns by keeping an accuracy close to that of the underlying first-principles framework. Our findings demonstrate that the high atomic mobility is related to the presence of clusters of slow and fast moving atoms. The latter contain a large fraction of chains of homopolar Ge?Ge bonds, which at low temperatures have a tendency to move by discontinuous cage-jump rearrangements. This structural fingerprint of dynamical heterogeneity provides an explanation of the breakdown of the Stokes?Einstein relation in GeTe, which is the ultimate origin of the fast crystallization of phase change materials exploited in the devices.},

The cholesterol crystals induce physical injury in the plaque core, promoting cell apoptosis and triggering an increased inflammatory response. Herein we address the question of how cholesterol crystal formation occurs in atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that three-dimensional (3D) cholesterol crystals can undergo directed nucleation from bilayer membranes containing two-dimensional (2D) cholesterol crystalline domains. We studied crystal formation on supported lipid bilayers loaded with exogenous cholesterol and labeled using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes ordered cholesterol arrays. Our findings show that 3D crystals are formed exclusively on the bilayer regions where there are segregated 2D cholesterol crystalline domains and that they form on the domains. This study has potentially significant implications for our understanding of the crucial step in the mechanism by which atherosclerotic lesions form.},

There are substantial differences in the phase and structure behavior of the crystalline domains formed within the bilayers relative to the corresponding monolayers, due to interactions between the opposing lipid leaflets. Depending on the lipid composition, these interactions lead to phase separation and formation of cholesterol crystals. The cholesterol and ceramide/cholesterol mixed phases were further characterized at 37°C by immunolabeling with specific antibodies recognizing ordered molecular arrays of cholesterol. Previous studies have shown that cholesterol may nucleate in artificial membranes to form thick two-dimensional bilayer crystals.

The simulation results for clusters of increasing size highlight the processes that take place during the initial stages of cholesterol aggregation at low coverage. Our results show that at T = 280 K clusters form spontaneously out of a dilute two-dimensional (2D) vapor of cholesterol molecules, driven by entropy and potential energy. Up to n = 10, corresponding to 25\% coverage for our simulation cell, cholesterol molecules lay flat on the water surface, forming fluid-like 2D aggregates. Within each island, the elongated cholesterol molecules align their longest axis along a common direction, anticipating the liquid-crystal character of bulk phases. With increasing cluster size, the adsorption energy per molecule quickly saturates to a value close to the limiting value for a full monolayer coverage. Cholesterol adsorption locally changes the electrostatic surface polarization of water, giving rise to an induced moment that tends to compensate the dipole of the adsorbed island. Computations for a single cholesterol molecule and dimer in bulk water are reported for a comparison. The absorption energy of both species in bulk water is larger than their adsorption energy at the water surface, thus pointing to entropy as the origin of the amphiphilic character of cholesterol.},

	abstract = {The atomic structure of metallic glasses has been a long-standing scientific problem. Unlike crystalline metals, where long-range ordering is established by periodic stacking of fundamental building blocks known as unit cells, a metallic glass has no long-range translational or orientational order, although some degrees of short- and medium-range order do exist. Previous studies have identified solute- (minority atom)-centred clusters as the fundamental building blocks or short-range order in metallic glasses. Idealized cluster packing schemes, such as efficient cluster packing on a cubic lattice and icosahedral packing as in a quasicrystal, have been proposed and provided first insights on the medium-range order in metallic glasses. However, these packing schemes break down beyond a length scale of a few clusters. Here, on the basis of neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments, we propose a new packing scheme—self-similar packing of atomic clusters. We show that the medium-range order has the characteristics of a fractal network with a dimension of 2.31, and is described by a power-law correlation function over the medium-range length scale. Our finding provides a new perspective of order in disordered materials and has broad implications for understanding their structure–property relationship, particularly those involving a change in length scales.},

Here, we have systematically investigated the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) phases of cholesteryl derivatives at the A−W interface employing surface manometry, epifluorescence, Brewster-angle and reflection microscopy techniques. We found that the short-chain ester cholesteryl acetate forms a stable monolayer. The higher homologues cholesteryl heptanoate and cholesteryl octanoate do not form monolayers; they yield 3D crystallites at very large area per molecule. Interestingly, we found cholesteryl nonanoate to be in the crossover regime in the homologous series of cholesteryl esters. It spontaneously forms a fluidlike bilayer at the A−W interface. The higher homologue cholesteryl laurate forms an unstable bilayer phase. The long-chain esters cholesteryl myristate, cholesteryl palmitate, and cholesteryl stearate exhibit crystalline bilayer and 3D structures. Cholesteryl benzoate, which contains a bulkier phenyl group instead of the flexible alkyl chain, forms a crystalline bilayer. We discuss the assembly of molecules in the different phases at the A−W interface for the cholesteryl derivatives with respect to their packing in the bulk and the onset of the smectic liquid-crystalline phase.},

The various stages of cholesterol molecular assembly from monolayer to three bilayers incorporating interleaving hydrogen-bonded water layers in a monoclinic cholesterol·H2O phase, has been monitored and their structures characterized to near atomic resolution. Crystallographic evidence is presented that this multilayer phase is similar to that of a reported metastable cholesterol phase of undetermined structure obtained from bile before transformation to the triclinic phase of cholesterol·H2O, the thermodynamically stable macroscopic form. According to grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements and crystallographic data, a transformation from the monoclinic film structure to a multilayer of the stable monohydrate phase involves, at least initially, an intralayer cholesterol rearrangement in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transition. The preferred nucleation of the monoclinic phase of cholesterol·H2O followed by transformation to the stable monohydrate phase may be associated with an energetically more stable cholesterol bilayer arrangement of the former and a more favorable hydrogen-bonding arrangement of the latter.

Both give similar results when compared at the same temperature difference with the model?s melting temperature. The size of the critical cluster varies from ?8000 molecules (radius = 4 nm) at 15 K below melting to ?600 molecules (radius = 1.7 nm) at 35 K below melting. We use Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) to estimate the ice?water interfacial free energy and the nucleation free-energy barrier. We obtain an interfacial free energy of 29(3) mN/m from an extrapolation of our results to the melting temperature. This value is in good agreement both with experimental measurements and with previous estimates from computer simulations of TIP4P-like models. Moreover, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate from simulations of the critical cluster at the barrier top. The values we get for both models agree within statistical error with experimental measurements. At temperatures higher than 20 K below melting, we get nucleation rates slower than the appearance of a critical cluster in all water of the hydrosphere during the age of the universe. Therefore, our simulations predict that water freezing above this temperature must necessarily be heterogeneous.},

However, the tendency of cholesterol to crystallize in the form of biaxially grown particles was evidenced as dominating the precipitation processes, irrespective of any modifications of experimental parameters involved in the preparation procedure investigated hereby. Prolonged aging time and temperature effects lead to “face-to-face” aggregation of particles, promoted by the discrepancy in surface charges between particle sides and faces.

Application of the original version of the method for molecular systems has been hampered by the fact that these systems geometrically represent ensembles of partially overlapping spheres of different radii. The generalized version of the method is based on using the additively weighed Voronoi diagram, representing the locus of spatial points being equally far from the surface rather than the center of the corresponding pair of atoms. This version of the Voronoi?Delaunay method can be readily used to reveal and analyze voids accessible for probes of different radii even in rather complex molecular systems. When the properties of the voids present in the simulated DMPC membrane are investigated, their shape, size, and orientation have been analyzed in detail in the different regions of the membrane located at different depths along the membrane normal axis. The characteristics of the voids are found to be different in different regions of the bilayer, namely (i) at the middle of the membrane, in the region of the hydrophobic lipid tails, (ii) in the region of the hydrophilic zwitterionic headgroups, and (iii) in the region of the bulklike water adjacent to the bilayer. The largest and oblong voids are found in the middle of the membrane, with a preferred orientation that is parallel to the bilayer normal axis. A clear correlation between the orientation of the voids and the orientation of the lipid chains is observed. In the bulk water region the fraction of the empty space is even higher than at the middle of the membrane; however, here the voids are distributed more uniformly. Finally, in the high-density region of the hydrophilic headgroups the voids are found, on average, smaller than in the other parts of the system.},

	abstract = {Abstractauthoren Phase change memories rest on the ability of some chalcogenide alloys to undergo a fast and reversible transition between the crystalline and amorphous phases upon Joule heating. The fast crystallization is due to a high nucleation rate and a large crystal growth velocity which are actually possible thanks to the fragility of the supercooled liquid that allows for the persistence of a high atomic mobility at high supercooling where the thermodynamical driving force for crystallization is also high. Since crystallization in the devices occurs by rapidly heating the amorphous phase, hysteretic effects might arise with a different diffusion coefficient and viscosity on heating than on cooling. In this work, we have quantified these hysteretic effects in the phase change compound GeTe by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The atomic mobility in the overheated amorphous phase is lower than in supercooled liquid at the same temperature and the viscosity is consequently higher. Still, the simulations of the overheated amorphous phase reveal a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity, similarly to what we found previously in the supercooled liquid. Evidences are provided that the breakdown is due to the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities at high supercooling.},

	abstract = {Upon cooling, water freezes to ice. This familiar phase transition occurs widely in nature, yet unlike the freezing of simple liquids1, 2, 3, it has never been successfully simulated on a computer. The difficulty lies with the fact that hydrogen bonding between individual water molecules yields a disordered three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network whose rugged and complex global potential energy surface4, 5, 6 permits a large number of possible network configurations. As a result, it is very challenging to reproduce the freezing of 'real' water into a solid with a unique crystalline structure. For systems with a limited number of possible disordered hydrogen-bond network structures, such as confined water, it is relatively easy to locate a pathway from a liquid state to a crystalline structure7, 8, 9. For pure and spatially unconfined water, however, molecular dynamics simulations of freezing are severely hampered by the large number of possible network configurations that exist. Here we present a molecular dynamics trajectory that captures the molecular processes involved in the freezing of pure water. We find that ice nucleation occurs once a sufficient number of relatively long-lived hydrogen bonds develop spontaneously at the same location to form a fairly compact initial nucleus. The initial nucleus then slowly changes shape and size until it reaches a stage that allows rapid expansion, resulting in crystallization of the entire system.},

	abstract = {What makes a material a good ice nucleating agent? Despite the importance of heterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to microbiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still prevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the ability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a function of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation rates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal, varying the water?surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It turns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice, customarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice nucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other hand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity can significantly alter the ice nucleation rate and can also lead to the formation of up to three different faces of ice on the same substrate. We have pinpointed three circumstances where heterogeneous ice nucleation can be promoted by the crystalline surface: (i) the formation of a water overlayer that acts as an in-plane template; (ii) the emergence of a contact layer buckled in an ice-like manner; and (iii) nucleation on compact surfaces with very high interaction strength. We hope that this extensive systematic study will foster future experimental work aimed at testing the physiochemical understanding presented herein.},

The ice nucleation process based on the standard and classical theory of homogeneous freezing initiates within the interior volume of a cloud droplet. Current experimental data on homogeneous freezing rates of ice in droplets of supercooled water, both in air and emulsion oil samples, show considerable scatter. For example, at −33°C, the reported volume-based freezing rates of ice in supercooled water vary by as many as 5 orders of magnitude, which is well outside the range of measurement uncertainties. Here, we show that the process of ice nucleus formation at the air (or oil)-liquid water interface may help to explain why experimental results on ice nucleation rates yield different results in different ambient phases. Our results also suggest that surface crystallization of ice in cloud droplets can explain why low amounts of supercooled water have been observed in the atmosphere near −40°C.},

Concepts for experimental techniques suitable to study homogeneous ice nucleation are addressed, in particular differential scanning calorimetry of inverse emulsions. Ice nucleation data from aqueous solutions have been analyzed using two approaches, and the interrelations between those are examined. It is argued that the ice nucleation process is driven entirely by thermodynamic quantities and how this can be understood in the context of three proposed theories for supercooled liquid water. Ice nucleation data for pure water droplets surrounded by a gas have been compiled and evaluated; within experimental uncertainty neither a volume dependent nucleation process nor a surface dependent nucleation process is convincingly supported by the analysis. Finally, open questions in the area of supercooled aqueous solutions and ice nucleation are discussed.},

In this work, we perform hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of the heterogeneous nucleation of ice on a range of generic surfaces, both flat and structured, in order to probe the underlying factors affecting the nucleation process. The structured surfaces we study comprise one basal plane bilayer of ice with varying lattice parameters and interaction strengths. We show that what determines the propensity for nucleation is not just the surface attraction, but also the orientational ordering imposed on liquid water near a surface. In particular, varying the ratio of the surface\&apos;s attraction and orientational ordering can change the mechanism by which nucleation occurs: ice can nucleate on the structured surface even when the orientational ordering imposed by the surface is weak, as the water molecules that interact strongly with the surface are themselves a good template for further growth. We also show that lattice matching is important for heterogeneous nucleation on the structured surface we study. We rationalise these brute-force simulation results by explicitly calculating the interfacial free energies of ice and liquid water in contact with the nucleating surface and their variation with surface interaction parameters.},

In this work, we use molecular dynamics and two advanced sampling techniques, forward flux sampling and umbrella sampling, to study homogeneous nucleation of ice in free-standing thin films of supercooled water. We use a coarse-grained monoatomic model of water, known as mW, and we find that in this model a vapor–liquid interface suppresses crystallization in its vicinity. This suppression occurs in the vicinity of flat interfaces where no net Laplace pressure in induced. Our free energy calculations reveal that the pre-critical crystalline nuclei that emerge near the interface are thermodynamically less stable than those that emerge in the bulk. We investigate the origin of this instability by computing the average asphericity of nuclei that form in different regions of the film, and observe that average asphericity increases closer to the interface, which is consistent with an increase in the free energy due to increased surface-to-volume ratios.},

Kaolinite is a clay that is a significant component of airborne particles and is an effective ice nucleus. Despite receiving considerable attention, the microscopic mechanism(s) by which kaolinite nucleates ice is not known. We report molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation by kaolinite (001) surfaces. Both the Al-surface and the Si-surface nucleate ice. For the Al-surface, reorientation of the surface hydroxyl groups is essential for ice nucleation. This flexibility allows the Al-surface to adopt a structure which is compatible with ice Ih at the atomic level. On the rigid Si-surface, ice nucleates via an unusual structure that consists of an ordered arrangement of hexagonal and cubic ice layers, joined at their basal planes where the interfacial energy cost is low. This ice structure provides a good match to the atomistic structure of the Si-surface. This example is important and may have far reaching implications because it demonstrates that potential ice nuclei need not be good atomic-level matches to particular planes of Ih or Ic. It suggests that surfaces can act as effective ice nuclei by matching one of the much larger set of planes that can be constructed by regular arrangements of hexagonal and cubic ice.},

	abstract = {Determining the change in topological properties like shape, flexibility and packing of proteins and nucleic acids on complexation is important in characterizing the role of induced structural changes and various interactions which control the functional specificity of proteins and nucleic acids. To this end, we have analyzed and compared the three dimensional structures of several protein–protein, protein–DNA and protein–RNA complexes available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the Nucleic Acid Data Bank (NDB). The size of complexed proteins and nucleic acids, as measured by the radius of gyration, follows Flory's scaling law. The change in the scaling exponents for proteins, RNA and DNA reflects the changes in their respective sizes due to complexation. The anisotropy in the shape of proteins, DNA and RNA in complexes is measured by considering the asphericity and shape parameter, which are calculated from the eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor. The distribution of asphericity and shape shows that complexed proteins are mostly spherically symmetrical, while DNA and RNA in complexed states are largely prolate and considerably more aspherical compared to the proteins. Persistence length characterizes the intrinsic flexibility/rigidity of proteins and nucleic acids. The flexibility of all biomolecules decreases with the chain length. For small DNA molecules (6–147 base pairs), persistence length is larger compared to RNA and proteins in protein–protein and protein–RNA complexes. The flexibility of DNA increases, while RNA decreases, in their respective complexed states as compared to that of proteins which remain almost unchanged. The two body contact analysis confirms that the side-chain–backbone contacts are predominant compared to sidechain–sidechain and backbone–backbone contacts in the complexed proteins. The average packing density of proteins decreases in their complexed states, which is measured by the mean value of the contact density of their alpha carbon atoms. The average number of hydrogen bonds are found to be less in the interface region of protein–protein complexes compared to that in protein–DNA and protein–RNA complexes.},

	abstract = {The formation of ice affects many aspects of our everyday life as well as important technologies such as cryotherapy and cryopreservation. Foreign substances almost always aid water freezing through heterogeneous ice nucleation, but the molecular details of this process remain largely unknown. In fact, insight into the microscopic mechanism of ice formation on different substrates is difficult to obtain even if state-of-the-art experimental techniques are used. At the same time, atomistic simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation frequently face extraordinary challenges due to the complexity of the water-substrate interaction and the long time scales that characterize nucleation events. Here, we have investigated several aspects of molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation considering as a prototypical ice nucleating material the clay mineral kaolinite, which is of relevance in atmospheric science. We show via seeded molecular dynamics simulations that ice nucleation on the hydroxylated (001) face of kaolinite proceeds exclusively via the formation of the hexagonal ice polytype. The critical nucleus size is two times smaller than that obtained for homogeneous nucleation at the same supercooling. Previous findings suggested that the flexibility of the kaolinite surface can alter the time scale for ice nucleation within molecular dynamics simulations. However, we here demonstrate that equally flexible (or non flexible) kaolinite surfaces can lead to very different outcomes in terms of ice formation, according to whether or not the surface relaxation of the clay is taken into account. We show that very small structural changes upon relaxation dramatically alter the ability of kaolinite to provide a template for the formation of a hexagonal overlayer of water molecules at the water-kaolinite interface, and that this relaxation therefore determines the nucleation ability of this mineral.},

We employ a thermodynamic route proposed by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys.123, 134703 (2005)] to determine the surface tension that involves the estimate of the change in free energy associated with a small change in the interfacial area at constant volume. The values of the surface tension computed from this test-area method are found to be fully consistent with those obtained from the standard mechanical route, which is based on the evaluation of the components of the pressuretensor. We find that most models do not reproduce quantitatively the experimental values of the surface tension of water. The best description of the surface tension is given by those models that provide a better description of the vapor-liquid coexistence curve. The values of the surface tension for the SPC/E and TIP4P/Ew models are found to be in reasonably good agreement with the experimental values. From the present investigation, we conclude that the TIP4P/2005 model is able to accurately describe the surface tension of water over the whole range of temperatures from the triple point to the critical temperature. We also conclude that the test area is an appropriate methodological choice for the calculation of the surface tension not only for simple fluids, but also for complex molecular polar fluids, as is the case of water.},

The structure and dynamics of both monolayers and interfacial water are compared across the range of surface pressures at which stable monolayers can form. For PA monolayers at T = 300 K, the untilted condensed phase with a hexagonal lattice structure is found at high surface pressure, while the uniformly tilted condensed phase with a centered rectangular lattice structure is observed at low surface pressure, in agreement with the available experimental data. A state with uniform chain tilt but no periodic spatial ordering is observed for DPPA monolayers on a Na+/water subphase at both high and low surface pressures. The hydrophobic acyl chains of both monolayers pack efficiently at all surface pressures, resulting in a very small number of gauche defects. The analysis of the hydrogen-bonding structure/dynamics at the monolayer/water interface indicates that water molecules hydrogen-bonded to the DPPA head groups reorient more slowly than those hydrogen-bonded to the PA head groups, with the orientational dynamics becoming significantly slower at high surface pressure. Possible implications for physicochemical processes taking place on marine aerosols in the atmosphere are discussed.},

The implementation has full support both for CHARMM-specific features such as multiple potentials over the same dihedral angle and the grid-based energy correction map on the ϕ, ψ protein backbone dihedrals, as well as all GROMACS features such as virtual hydrogen interaction sites that enable 5 fs time steps. The medium-to-long time effects of both the correction maps and virtual sites have been tested by performing a series of 100 ns simulations using different models for water representation, including comparisons between CHARMM and traditional TIP3P. Including the correction maps improves sampling of near native-state conformations in our systems, and to some extent it is even able to refine distorted protein conformations. Finally, we show that this accuracy is largely maintained with a new implicit solvent implementation that works with virtual interaction sites, which enables performance in excess of 250 ns/day for a 900-atom protein on a quad-core desktop computer.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary surfactant provides for a lipid rich film at the lung air–water interface, which prevents alveolar collapse at the end of expiration. The films are likely enriched in the major surfactant component dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which, due to its saturated fatty acid chains, can withstand high surface pressures up to 70 mN/m, thereby reducing surface tension in that interface to very low values (close to 1 mN/m). Despite many experimental measurements in situ, as well as in vitro for native lung surfactant films, the exact mechanism by which other fluid lipid components of surfactant, in combination with surfactant proteins, allow for such low surface tension values to be reached is not well understood. We have performed molecular dynamics simulation of films composed of DPPC alone and in mixtures with other fluid and acidic lipid components of surfactant at the high densities relevant to the low surface tension regime. 10–50 ns simulations were performed with the software GROMACS, with 40–64 lipids molecules plus water, using 5 different lipid compositions and 7 different areas per lipid. The primary focus was to learn how differences in lipid composition affect the response of the monolayer to compression, such as the development of curvature or the loss of lipids to the exterior of the monolayer. The systems studied exhibit features of two of the major schools of thought of lung surfactant mechanisms, in that although unsaturated lipids did not appear to prevent the monolayers from achieving high surface pressure, POPG did appear to be selectively squeezed out of the DPPC/POPG monolayers at high lipid densities.},

The lattice contribution to the thermal boundary resistance has been computed by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with an interatomic potential based on a neural network scheme. We find that the electron-phonon term contributes to the thermal boundary resistance to an extent which is strongly dependent on the concentration and mobility of the holes. Further, for measured values of the holes concentration and electrical conductivity, the electron-phonon term is larger than the contribution from the lattice.

	abstract = {We report a comparative periodic density functional theory study of the reaction of water dissociation on five platinum surfaces, e.g., Pt(111) Pt(100), Pt(110), Pt(211), and Pt(321). These surfaces were chosen to study the surface structural effects in the reaction of water dissociation. It was found that water molecules adsorb stronger on surfaces presenting low coordinated atoms in the surface. In the cases of the stepped Pt(110) and kinked Pt(321) surfaces, the activation energy barriers are smaller than the adsorption energies for the water molecule on the corresponding surfaces. Therefore, the calculations suggest that the dissociation reaction will take place preferentially at corner or edge sites on platinum particles with the (110) orientation. The inclusion of the results obtained in this work in previous derived BEP relationships confirms that the adsorption energy of the reaction products arises as the most appropriate descriptor for water dissociation on transition metal surfaces.},

This coarse-grained model is assessed here through the calculation of fundamental properties of bulk liquid water and the water–vapour interface. Accuracy and efficiency are evaluated and compared against simulations of standard three- and four-site atomistic models. For bulk liquid systems, ELBA reproduces accurately most of the investigated properties. However, the radial distribution function deviates from atomistic and experimental data, indicating a loss of local structure. The water–vapour interface, simulated over a range of temperatures from 300 to 600 K, is captured realistically in terms of its density distribution, and the accuracy in reproducing the experimental surface tension is as high as that of the best atomistic model. The critical temperature of ELBA is also found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. However, the interfacial electric field and surface potential are missing. The computational speed-up of ELBA compared to traditional atomistic models is estimated to be between one and two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {The electrostatic properties of lipidmembranes are of profound importance as they are directly associated with membrane potential and, consequently, with numerous membrane-mediated biological phenomena. Here we address a number of methodological issues related to the computation of the electrostatic potential from atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers. We discuss two slightly different forms of Poisson equation that are normally used to calculate the membrane potential: (i) a classical form when the potential and the electric field are chosen to be zero on one of the sides of a simulation box and (ii) an alternative form, when the potential is set to be the same on the opposite sides of a simulation box. Both forms differ by a position-dependent correction term, which has been shown to be proportional to the overall dipole moment of a bilayer system (for neutral systems). For symmetric bilayers we demonstrate that both approaches give essentially the same potential profiles, provided that simulations are long enough (a production run of at least 100 ns is required) and that fluctuations of the center of mass of a bilayer are properly accounted for. In contrast, for asymmetriclipid bilayers, the second approach is no longer appropriate due to a nonzero net dipole moment across a simulation box with a single asymmetric bilayer. We demonstrate that in this case the electrostatic potential can adequately be described by the classical form of Poisson equation, provided that it is employed in conjunction with tin-foil boundary conditions, which exactly balance a nonzero surface charge of a periodically replicated multibilayer system. Furthermore, we show that vacuum boundary conditions give qualitatively similar potential profiles for asymmetric lipid bilayers as compared to the conventional periodic boundaries, but accurate determination of the transmembrane potential difference is then hindered due to detachment of some water dipoles from bulk aqueous solution to vacuum.},

Comparisons of simulations with truncation schemes, Ewald summations, and modified Coulomb interactions, either by shift functions or reaction field models, to describe long-range electrostatics point out the artifacts inherent in each of these methods and above all those of straight cutoff methods. We further show that bilayer properties are less sensitive to the details of the pressure-coupling algorithm and that an increased integration time step of 5 fs can be safely used in simulations of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers.},

In the case of phase-change chalcogenide alloys the aging of the amorphous state is responsible for an increase of the electrical resistance with time. This phenomenon called drift is detrimental in the application of these materials in phase-change nonvolatile memories, which are emerging as promising candidates for storage class memories. By means of combined molecular dynamics and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory, we have unraveled the atomistic origin of the resistance drift in the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. The drift results from a widening of the band gap and a reduction of Urbach tails due to structural relaxations leading to the removal of chains of Ge-Ge homopolar bonds. The same structural features are actually responsible for the high mobility above the glass transition which boosts the crystallization speed exploited in the device.},

Since these methods rely on a finite number of atoms and molecules to describe the system, periodic boundary conditions are implemented to avoid edge effects and capture long-range electrostatic interactions. Systems consisting of a solvated bilayer adsorbed on a solid surface and exposed to an air/vacuum interface occur in many experimental settings and present some unique challenges in this respect. Here, we investigated the effects of implementing different electrostaticboundary conditions on the structural and electrostaticproperties of a quartz/water/vacuum interface and a similar quartz-supported hydrated lipid bilayer exposed to vacuum. Since these interfacial systems have a net polarization, implementing the standard Ewald summation with the conducting boundary condition for the electrostatic long-range interactions introduced an artificial periodicity in the out-of-plane dimension. In particular, abnormal orientational polarizations of water were observed with the conducting boundary condition. Implementing the Ewald summation technique with the planar vacuum boundary condition and calculating electrostaticproperties compatible with the implemented electrostaticboundary condition removed these inconsistencies. This formulation is generally applicable to similar interfacial systems in bulk solution.},

This improved efficiency allows the calculation of rate constants in complex molecular systems. As an example, we study rearrangement processes in a cluster consisting of seven Lennard-Jones particles in two dimensions.

This review is intended to outline the basic principles as well as a survey of the field.

	abstract = {Current computer simulations of biomolecules typically make use of classical molecular dynamics methods, as a very large number (tens to hundreds of thousands) of atoms are involved over timescales of many nanoseconds. The methodology for treating short-range bonded and van der Waals interactions has matured. However, long-range electrostatic interactions still represent a bottleneck in simulations. In this article, we introduce the basic issues for an accurate representation of the relevant electrostatic interactions. In spite of the huge computational time demanded by most biomolecular systems, it is no longer necessary to resort to uncontrolled approximations such as the use of cutoffs. In particular, we discuss the Ewald summation methods, the fast particle mesh methods, and the fast multipole methods. We also review recent efforts to understand the role of boundary conditions in systems with long-range interactions, and conclude with a short perspective on future trends.},

A small magnitude of both quantities is an inherent characteristic of phase-change materials.

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

We combine Gauge-Including Projector Augmented Waves (GIPAW) calculations at relaxed structures, fully including dispersion forces, with Magic Angle Spinning Solid State NMR experiments and spectral editing to achieve a detailed interpretation of the complex NMR spectra of cholesterol crystals. By introducing an environment-dependent secondary referencing scheme in our calculations, not only do we reproduce the characteristic spectral features of the different crystalline polymorphs, thus clearly discriminating among them, but also closely represent the spectrum in the region of several highly overlapping peaks. This, in combination with spectral editing, allows us to provide a complete peak assignment for monohydrate (ChM) and low-temperature anhydrous (ChAl) crystal polymorphs. Our results show that the synergy between ab initio calculations and refined experimental techniques can be exploited for an accurate and efficient NMR crystallography of complex systems of great interest for biomaterial studies.

Various mechanisms to eliminate the macroscopic dipole and in so-doing stabilize the basal surface are considered. The most promising option identified so far involves the adsorption of foreign atoms (for example, Na and Cl atoms) on the perfect basal surface, since this yields a non-metallic surface with a cleavage energy lower than the unreconstructed polar basal surface.

It is based on the Voronoi–Delaunay tessellation of structures, obtained in molecular simulations: successive Voronoi shells are constructed, starting from the interface between the solute molecule and the solvent, and continuing to the outside (into the solvent) as well as into the interior of the molecule. Similarly, successive Delaunay shells, consisting of Delaunay simplexes, can also be constructed. This technique can be applied to interpret volumetric data, obtained, for example, in studies of proteins in aqueous solution. In particular, it allows replacing qualitatively and descriptively introduced properties by strictly defined quantities, such as the thermal volume, by the boundary voids. The extension and the temperature behavior of the boundary region, its structure and composition are discussed in detail, using the example of a molecular dynamics model of an aqueous solution of the human amyloid polypeptide, hIAPP. We show that the impact of the solute on the local density of the solvent is short ranged, limited to the first Delaunay and the first Voronoi shell around the solute. The extra void volume, created in the boundary region between solute and solvent, determines the magnitude and the temperature dependence of the apparent volume of the solute molecule.},

	abstract = {The early stages of crystallization of tetrahedral systems remain largely unknown, due to experimental limitations in spatial and temporal resolutions. Computer simulations, when combined with advanced sampling techniques, can provide valuable details about nucleation at the atomistic level. Here we describe a computational approach that combines the forward flux sampling method with molecular dynamics, and we apply it to the study of nucleation in supercooled liquidsilicon. We investigated different supercooling temperatures, namely, 0.79, 0.86, and 0.95 of the equilibrium melting point T m . Our results show the calculated nucleation rates decrease from 5.52 ± 1.75 × 10 28 to 4.77 ± 3.26 × 10 11 m − 3 s − 1 at 0.79 and 0.86 T m , respectively. A comparison between simulation results and those of classical nucleation theory shows that the free energy of the liquid solid interface γ l s inferred from our computations differ by about 28\% from that obtained for bulk liquid solid interfaces. However the computed values of γ l s appear to be rather insensitive to supercooling temperature variations. Our simulations also yield atomistic details of the nucleation process, including the atomic structure of critical nuclei and lifetime distributions of subcritical nuclei.},

	abstract = {Understanding the nucleation of hydrate is the key to developing effective strategies for controlling methane hydrate formation. Here we present a computational study of methane hydrate nucleation, by combining the forward flux sampling (FFS) method and the coarse-grained water model mW. To facilitate the application of FFS in studying the formation of methane hydrate, we developed an effective order parameter ? on the basis of the topological analysis of the tetrahedral network. The order parameter capitalizes the signature of hydrate structure, i.e., polyhedral cages, and is capable of efficiently distinguishing hydrate from ice and liquid water while allowing the formation of different hydrate phases, i.e., sI, sII, and amorphous. Integration of the order parameter ? with FFS allows explicitly computing hydrate nucleation rates and obtaining an ensemble of nucleation trajectories under conditions where spontaneous hydrate nucleation becomes too slow to occur in direct simulation. The convergence of the obtained hydrate nucleation rate was found to depend crucially on the convergence of the spatial distribution for the spontaneously formed hydrate seeds obtained from the initial sampling of FFS. The validity of the approach is also verified by the agreement between the calculated nucleation rate and that inferred from the direct simulation. Analyzing the obtained large ensemble of hydrate nucleation trajectories, we show hydrate formation at 220 K and 500 bar is initiated by the nucleation events occurring in the vicinity of water?methane interface, and facilitated by a gradual transition from amorphous to crystalline structure. The latter provides the direct support to the proposed two-step nucleation mechanism of methane hydrate.},

	abstract = {The investigation of cavitation in metastable liquids with molecular simulations requires an appropriate definition of the volume of the vapour bubble forming within the metastable liquid phase. Commonly used approaches for bubble detection exhibit two significant flaws: first, when applied to water they often identify the voids within the hydrogen bond network as bubbles thus masking the signature of emerging bubbles and, second, they lack thermodynamic consistency. Here, we present two grid-based methods, the M-method and the V-method, to detect bubbles in metastable water specifically designed to address these shortcomings. The M-method incorporates information about neighbouring grid cells to distinguish between liquid- and vapour-like cells, which allows for a very sensitive detection of small bubbles and high spatial resolution of the detected bubbles. The V-method is calibrated such that its estimates for the bubble volume correspond to the average change in system volume and are thus thermodynamically consistent. Both methods are computationally inexpensive such that they can be used in molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of cavitation. We illustrate them by computing the free energy barrier and the size of the critical bubble for cavitation in water at negative pressure.},

We studied crystal nucleation at T = 800 and 825 K . We observe that the critical nucleus formed during the nucleation process has the crystal structure of bulk NaCl. Interestingly, the critical nucleus is clearly faceted, the nuclei have a cubical shape. We have computed the crystal-nucleation rate using two completely different approaches, one based on an estimate of the rate of diffusive crossing of the nucleation barrier, the other based on the forward flux sampling and transition interface sampling methods. We find that the two methods yield the same result within an order of magnitude. However, when we compare the extrapolated simulation data with the only available experimental results for NaCl nucleation, we observe a discrepancy of nearly five orders of magnitude. We discuss the possible causes for this discrepancy.},

Compared to the DFT functionals BLYP and BLYP-D (where the latter contains a simple dispersion correction), SCP-DFT yields interactionenergies per molecule and harmonic frequencies of clusters in better agreement with experiment, with errors in the former of only a few tenths of a kcal/mol. BLYP and BLYP-D underbind and overbind the clusters, respectively, by up to about 1 kcal/mol. For liquid water, both BLYP and SCP-DFT predict radial distribution functions that are similar and overstructured compared to experiment. However, SCP-DFT improves over BLYP in predicting the experimental enthalpy of vaporization. A decomposition of the dimer interactionenergy attempts to rationalize the performance of SCP-DFT. The SCP-DFT approach holds promise as an efficient and accurate method for describing large hydrogen-bonded systems, and has the potential to model complex systems with minimal parametrization.},

The focus of the article is to demonstrate the problems which can arise in obtaining adequately sampled free energies. The time scale on which “adiabatic switching” may be performed to calculate the free energy of the ab initio system relative to a classical reference state is discussed. To provide a consistency check, two reference states for this thermodynamic integration are used, the one component plasma and the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system. These illustrate particular difficulties which can arise. In the LJ case, for example, the intermediate fluid states which arise in integrating from the LJ fluid to the full ab initio description of Al are found to freeze. Ultimately, consistent results are obtained.},

They differ from cholesterol by the presence of additional polar groups that are typically hydroxyl, keto, hydroperoxy, epoxy, or carboxyl moieties. Under typical conditions, oxysterol concentration is maintained at a very low and precisely regulated level, with an excess of cholesterol. Like cholesterol, many oxysterols are hydrophobic and hence confined to cell membranes. However, small chemical differences between the sterols can significantly affect how they interact with other membrane components, and this in turn can have a substantial effect on membrane properties. In this spirit, this review describes the biological importance and the roles of oxysterols in the human body. We focus primarily on the effect of oxysterols on lipid membranes, but we also consider other issues such as enzymatic and nonenzymatic synthesis processes of oxysterols as well as pathological conditions induced by oxysterols.},

It was found that the fraction of aerosol particles forming ice crystals was influenced by the temperature, the mean radius of aerosol particles and the degree of oxidising of the soot particle surface. It was suggested that oxidising affected the concentration of surface chemical groups that could form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. A decrease in the temperature and an increase in the radius of particles led to an increase in the number of ice crystals. Data obtained were parameterised and an expression was derived that enables the concentration of ice crystals to be calculated for conditions in a low cloud. Based on these experiments, this particular soot is a very potent source of ice nuclei. Data obtained were compared with Fletcher theory. It was shown that the theory contradicts experimental data and cannot be recommended for evaluation of the number of ice crystals in clouds. An application of the data obtained to aircraft condensation trail formation is discussed.},

In the particular and very important case of aqueous systems, the commonly used force-fields tend to offer quite different predictions with respect to a wide range of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, including the ease of ice nucleation, the propensity to freeze at a vapor–liquid interface, and the existence of a liquid–liquid phase transition. It is thus of fundamental and practical interest to understand how different features of a given water model affect its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. In this work, we use the forward-flux sampling technique to study the crystallization kinetics of a family of modified Stillinger–Weber (SW) potentials with energy (ε) and length (σ) scales taken from the monoatomic water (mW) model, but with different tetrahedrality parameters (λ). By increasing λ from 21 to 24, we observe the nucleation rate increases by 48 orders of magnitude at a supercooling of ζ = T/Tm = 0.845. Using classical nucleation theory, we are able to demonstrate that this change can largely be accounted for by the increase in {\textbar}Δμ{\textbar}, the thermodynamic driving force. We also perform rate calculations in freestanding thin films of the supercooled liquid, and observe a crossover from surface-enhanced crystallization at λ = 21 to bulk-dominated crystallization for λ ≥ 22.},

	abstract = {The recently developed immersion mode cooling chamber has been used as an extension of the Zurich ice nucleation chamber (ZINC) in order to measure the ice nucleation efficiency of size-selected kaolinite particles in the immersion mode. Particles with selected diameters of 200, 400, and 800 nm have been activated as cloud condensation nuclei in order to obtain water droplets with single immersed particles. After continuous cooling of the droplets to the experimental temperature in ZINC, the frozen fraction of the droplets was measured with a recently developed depolarization detector, the ice optical detector (IODE). Temperatures below −30°C were necessary to freeze 50\% of the droplets throughout the investigated size range. Although not very strong, a size dependence of the freezing efficiency has been observed. The median freezing temperature increases from −35°C for 200 nm kaolinite particles to −33°C for 800 nm particles. An experiment with 200 nm ammonium sulfate particles in the same temperature range resulted in no significant frozen fraction of the droplets. This suggests that the ice crystals observed in experiments with kaolinite particles nucleated heterogeneously. The temperature-dependent frozen fraction of water droplets has been fitted with different theoretical models. Comparison of the resulting fit curves with the data suggests that including the concept of active sites in the description of the ice nucleus surface is more appropriate than the approximation of a constant contact angle.},

This method is still based on the Cartesian coordinate system and can be used in place of SHAKE and RATTLE. We implemented this algorithm in the SPASMS package of molecular mechanics and dynamics. Several series of molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to examine the performance of the new algorithm in comparison with the original RATTLE method. It was found that SETTLE is of higher accuracy and is faster than RATTLE with reasonable tolerances by three to nine times on a scalar machine. Furthermore, the performance improvement ranged from factors of 26 to 98 on a vector machine since the method presented is not iterative. © 1992 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

For silver iodide and kaolinite, supersaturation values of first ice formation are in good agreement (1–2\% absolute) with diffusion chamber experiments. For both substances, threshold temperatures for the condensation, freezing and deposition modes are also in good agreement (within 2 K) with previous literature data.

Measurements of the ice active particle fraction as a function of temperature and relative humidity with respect to ice are reported. The authors find enhanced activated fractions when water saturation is reached at mixed-phase-cloud temperatures between 235 and 241 K and a distinct increase in the activated fraction below 235 K at conditions below water saturation. To provide a functional description of the observed ice nucleation mechanisms, the experimental results are analyzed by two different particle-surface models within the framework of classical nucleation theory. Describing the ice nucleation activity of kaolinite particles by assuming deposition nucleation to be the governing mechanism below water saturation was found to be inadequate to represent the experimental data in the whole temperature range investigated. The observed increase in the activated fraction below water saturation and temperatures below 235 K corroborate the assumption that an appreciable amount of adsorbed or capillary condensed water is present on kaolinite particles, which favors ice nucleation.},

The computations in which the electrostatic interactions were truncated are compared to similar simulations using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) technique. All examined truncation distances (1.8–2.5 nm) lead to major effects on the bilayer properties, such as enhanced order of acyl chains together with decreased areas per lipid. The results obtained using PME, on the other hand, are consistent with experiments. These artifacts are interpreted in terms of radial distribution functions g(r) of molecules and molecular groups in the bilayer plane. Pronounced maxima or minima in g(r) appear exactly at the cutoff distance indicating that the truncation gives rise to artificial ordering between the polar phosphatidyl and choline groups of the DPPC molecules. In systems described using PME, such artificial ordering is not present.},

These applications rest on the fast and reversible switching between the amorphous and the crystalline phases, which takes place in the nano domain in both the time and the length scales. The fast crystallization is a key feature for the applications of phase change materials. In this work, we have investigated by means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations the crystal growth of the prototypical phase change compound GeTe at the interface between the crystalline and the supercooled liquid reached in the device upon heating the amorphous phase. A neural network interatomic potential, markedly faster with respect to first-principles methods, allowed us to consider high-symmetry crystalline surfaces as well as polycrystalline models that are very close to the actual geometry of the memory devices. We have found that the crystal growth from the interface is dominant at high temperatures while it is competing with homogeneous crystallization in the melt at lower temperatures. The crystal growth velocity markedly depends on the crystallographic plane exposed at the interface, the (100) surface being kinetically dominant with respect to the (111) surface. Polycrystalline interfaces, representative of realistic conditions in phase change memory devices, grow at significantly slower pace because of the presence of grain boundaries.},

We present two alternative methods for placing interfaces automatically and adaptively in their optimal locations, on-the-fly as an FFS simulation progresses, without prior knowledge or user intervention. These methods allow the FFS simulation to advance efficiently through bottlenecks in phase space by placing more interfaces where the probability of advancement is lower. The methods are demonstrated both for a single-particle test problem and for the crystallization of Yukawa particles. By removing the need for manual interface placement, our methods both facilitate the setting up of FFS simulations and improve their performance, especially for rare events which involve complex trajectories through phase space, with many bottlenecks.},

In FFS, interfaces are used to partition the phase space along an order parameter λ connecting the initial and final regions of interest. Since the kinetic “bottleneck” regions along the order parameter are not usually known beforehand, an adaptive procedure is used that first finds these regions by estimating the rate constants associated with reaching subsequent interfaces; thereafter, the FFS simulation is reset to concentrate the sampling on those bottlenecks. The approach can optimize for either the number and position of the interfaces (i.e., optimized λ phase staging) or the number M of fired trial runs per interface (i.e., the \{ M i \} set) to minimize the statistical error in the rate constant estimation per simulation period. For example, the optimization of the λ staging leads to a net constant flux of partial trajectories between interfaces and hence a constant flux of connected paths throughout the region between the two end states. The method is demonstrated for several test systems, including the folding of a lattice protein. It is shown that the proposed approach leads to an optimized λ staging and \{ M i \} set which increase the computational efficiency of the sampling algorithm.},

The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here—a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field.

Calculation of free-energy surfaces for molecular systems of interest in biology, chemistry and materials science, on the fly and a posteriori analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories using advanced collective variables.

Solution method:

Implementations of various collective variables and enhanced sampling techniques.

Reasons for new version:

The old version was difficult to maintain and its design was not as flexible as this new version. This lack of flexibility made it difficult to implement a number of novel methods that have emerged since the release of the original code.

Summary of revisions:

The new version of the code has a completely redesigned architecture, which allows for several important enhancements. This allows for a much simpler and robust input syntax and for improved performance. In addition, it provides several, more-complex collective variables which could not have been written using the previous implementation. Furthermore, the entire code is fully documented so it is easier to extend. Finally, the code is designed so that users can implement new variables directly in the input files and thus develop bespoke applications of these powerful algorithms.

Unusual features:

PLUMED 2 can be used either as a standalone program, e.g. for a posteriori analysis of trajectories, or as a library embedded in a molecular dynamics code (such as GROMACS, NAMD, Quantum ESPRESSO, and LAMMPS). Interfaces with these particular codes are provided in patches, which a simple script will insert into the underlying molecular dynamics codes source code files. For other molecular dynamics codes there is extensive documentation on how to add PLUMED in our manual.

Additional comments:

The distribution file contains a test suite, user and developer documentation and a collection of patches and utilities.

Running time:

Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. The regression test suite provided takes approximately 1 min to run.},

	abstract = {Across the world, many ice active bacteria utilize ice crystal controlling proteins for aid in freezing tolerance at subzero temperatures. Ice crystal controlling proteins include both antifreeze and ice nucleation proteins. Antifreeze proteins minimize freezing damage by inhibiting growth of large ice crystals, while ice nucleation proteins induce formation of embryonic ice crystals. Although both protein classes have differing functions, these proteins use the same ice binding mechanisms. Rather than direct binding, it is probable that these protein classes create an ice surface prior to ice crystal surface adsorption. Function is differentiated by molecular size of the protein. This paper reviews the similar and different aspects of bacterial antifreeze and ice nucleation proteins, the role of these proteins in freezing tolerance, prevalence of these proteins in psychrophiles, and current mechanisms of protein-ice interactions.},

	abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

The center of the hexagonal ring of oxygen atoms is vacant.

Analysis of the alumina face of kaolinite showed that the hexagonal surface lattice ring of hydroxyls surround a hydroxyl in the center of the ring. The atomic spacing between neighboring hydroxyls was determined as 0.36 ± 0.04 nm. Ordering of the kaolinite particles for examination of the silica and alumina surfaces was accomplished using different substrates, a procedure previously established.

These monolayers, consisting of aliphatic alcohols [CnH2n+1OH, n = 16?31) have been the subject of hexagonal ice (Ih) induction experiments over a range of temperatures. To learn more about the molecular basis of alcohol monolayer template?induced ice nucleation phenomena, we performed canonical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (1 ns) of pure C29, C30, and C31 alcohol monolayer?water droplet systems, using the reversible reference system propagation algorithm (r-RESPA). We find that the MD-determined monolayer physical parameters (at 278.15 K) exhibit reasonable agreement with experimentally determined values for crystalline C30 and C31 monolayers at 278.15 K. More importantly, as the simulation temperatures approach monolayer-specific freezing points, the water layer immediately below the monolayer surfaces adopted ?ice-like? lattice parameters and hexagonal or c-centered rectangular geometries that are characteristic of the (Ih) \{001\} plane. The analysis of monolayer ?OH headgroup orientations and surface topologies reveal that odd-carbon monolayers, and C31 in particular, are more effective nucleation templates, due to the following factors:? (1) ab-plane alcohol ?OH headgroup geometries which provide a closer ab-plane lattice match to the \{001\} Ih interface and (2) the presence of smoother monolayer headgroup topologies (i.e., azimuthal positioning), which permit a larger percentage of water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with the monolayer alcohol headgroups.},

This book offers a thorough update of all topics covered in the previous edition. In the last 16 years, soil chemistry as a discipline has assumed major significance in connection with global climate change. The 2nd edition addresses the emergent issue of global climate change by exploring the interaction between organic carbon and soil. The largest repository of organic carbon on earth is still soil, and the process by which organic carbon is sequestered by soil, thus preventing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is one of the proper concerns of soil chemistry. Thus, the revision provides a rigorous discussion of soil chemistry in its broader environmental and biogeochemical contexts},

	abstract = {Birch pollen grains are known to be ice nucleating active biological particles. The ice nucleating activity has previously been tracked down to biological macromolecules that can be easily extracted from the pollen grains in water. In the present study, we investigated the immersion freezing behavior of these ice nucleating active (INA) macromolecules. Therefore we measured the frozen fractions of particles generated from birch pollen washing water as a function of temperature at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS). Two different birch pollen samples were considered, with one originating from Sweden and one from the Czech Republic. For the Czech and Swedish birch pollen samples, freezing was observed to start at −19 and −17 °C, respectively. The fraction of frozen droplets increased for both samples down to −24 °C. Further cooling did not increase the frozen fractions any more. Instead, a plateau formed at frozen fractions below 1. This fact could be used to determine the amount of INA macromolecules in the droplets examined here, which in turn allowed for the determination of nucleation rates for single INA macromolecules. The main differences between the Swedish birch pollen and the Czech birch pollen were obvious in the temperature range between −17 and −24 °C. In this range, a second plateau region could be seen for Swedish birch pollen. As we assume INA macromolecules to be the reason for the ice nucleation, we concluded that birch pollen is able to produce at least two different types of INA macromolecules. We were able to derive parameterizations for the heterogeneous nucleation rates for both INA macromolecule types, using two different methods: a simple exponential fit and the Soccer ball model. With these parameterization methods we were able to describe the ice nucleation behavior of single INA macromolecules from both the Czech and the Swedish birch pollen.},

However, the exact mechanism of ice growth inhibition is still poorly understood as it is exceedingly difficult to experimentally analyze the molecular-scale growth kinetics of ice crystals at the planes to which the proteins bind. This review paper focuses on computer simulation studies on the mechanism of ice growth inhibition by AFPs. Recent molecular dynamics simulations of a growing ice–water interface to which protein is bound have indicated that, when the protein is stably bound to the interface, the growth rate of ice surrounding the protein decreases drastically, owing to depression of the ice melting point through the Gibbs–Thomson effect. The observed decrease in growth rate is expected to correspond to ice growth inhibition in real-world systems. In addition to presenting published simulation studies on the mechanism of ice growth inhibition by AFPs, this review also outlines the direction of future simulation studies in this field.},

This can lead to rational design of nucleants facilitating selective crystallisation of particles with desired properties. In this opinion, a review on recent advances in developing mechanistic understanding of the role of interfacial properties, mainly nano-scale surface topography, surface chemistry and the combination of both features, in controlling nucleation is presented.

Most atmospheric particles outside clouds are created in situ through nucleation from gas phase precursors and most ice particles within clouds are formed by nucleation, usually from the liquid. Thus, the nucleation process is of great significance in the Earth's atmosphere.The theoretical examination of nucleation in the atmosphere has been based mostly on classical nucleation theory. While diagnostically very useful, the prognostic skill demonstrated by this approach has been marginal. Microscopic approaches such as molecular dynamics and density functional theory have also proven useful in elucidating various aspects of the process but are not yet sufficiently refined to offer a significant prognostic advantage to the classical approach, due primarily to the heteromolecular nature of atmospheric nucleation. An important aspect of the nucleation process in the atmosphere is that the degree of metastability of the parent phase for the nucleation is modulated by a number of atmospheric processes such as condensation onto pre-existing particles, updraft velocities that are the main driving force for supersaturation of water (a major factor in all atmospheric nucleation), and photochemical production rates of nucleation precursors. Hence, atmospheric nucleation is both temporally and spatially inhomogeneous.},

The former is a threat in cold and the latter in dry environmental conditions. Here we show that a small xylem conduit diameter, which has previously been shown to be associated with lower cavitation pressure thus making a plant more drought resistant, is also associated with a decrease in the temperature required for ice nucleation in the xylem. Thus the susceptibility of freezing and cavitation are linked together in the xylem of plants. We explain this linkage by the regulation of the sizes of the nuclei catalysing freezing and drought cavitation. Our results offer better understanding of the similarities of adaption of plants to cold and drought stress, and offer new insights into the ability of plants to adapt to the changing environment.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the nature of binding of the organic phase (called kerogen) with clays and other minerals in gas and oil shale is of critical importance for developing optimal processes for hydrocarbon extraction and recovery. Here we report the results of an ab initio reactive study of a gaseous oil/clay interface, which consists of grafting fragments of sp3 methane and sp2 benzene onto the basal surface of illite. Methane and benzene fragments were selected as they correspond to the simplest monomers of the immature (aliphatic sp3 carbon atoms) and mature (aromatic sp2 carbon atoms) stages of the kerogen macromolecule while illite is encountered in many shale formations. We find that the methyl or phenyl radicals always bond upright to one of the outmost Si atoms of the clay phase, while the H atom attaches to the inner Al?OH group forming a water molecule. The covalent attachment of the radicals to the oxygen atoms of the clay surface is always less favorable than to the silicon atoms. The energetics of these grafted adducts are discussed along with the maturation state of the shale. An unanticipated signature of the covalent Si?C binding is the formation of hypervalent Si complexes, characterized by elongated bonds at the oil/clay interface. We complement our atomistic modeling by simulating IR spectra of the two covalently grafted interfaces (methyl?illite and phenyl?illite) which fingerprint elongated Si?C bonds in the frequency range 1100?1250 cm?1. This novel finding should have a large impact on the understanding of fracking conditions in shales through this tight- and loose-bonded organic/inorganic interface.},

Our understanding of these complex processes at the atomic level is provided by a few experimental and analytical methods such as X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopies. However, due to complexities in the structure and composition of clay and other hydrated minerals, and the inherent uncertainties of the experimental methods, it is important to apply theoretical molecular models for a fundamental atomic-level understanding, interpretation, and prediction of these phenomena. In this effort, we have developed a general force field, CLAYFF, suitable for the simulation of hydrated and multicomponent mineral systems and their interfaces with aqueous solutions. Interatomic potentials were derived from parametrizations incorporating structural and spectroscopic data for a variety of simple hydrated compounds. A flexible SPC-based water model is used to describe the water and hydroxyl behavior. Metal?oxygen interactions are described by a Lennard-Jones function and a Coulombic term with partial charges derived by Mulliken and ESP analysis of DFT results. Bulk structures, relaxed surface structures, and intercalation processes are evaluated and compared to experimental and spectroscopic findings for validation. Our approach differs from most others in that we treat most interatomic interactions as nonbonded. This allows us to effectively use the force field for a wide variety of phases and to properly account for energy and momentum transfer between the fluid phase and the solid, while keeping the number of parameters small enough to allow modeling of relatively large and highly disordered systems. Simulations of clay, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide phases and their interfaces with aqueous solutions combine energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods to describe the structure and behavior of water, hydroxyl, surface species, and intercalates in these systems. The results obtained to date demonstrate that CLAYFF shows good promise to evolve into a widely adaptable and broadly effective force field for molecular simulations of fluid interfaces with clays and other clay-related phases, as well as other inorganic materials characterized by complex, disordered, and often ill-determined structure and composition.},

	abstract = {It is surprisingly difficult to freeze water. Almost all ice that forms under “mild” conditions (temperatures {\textgreater} −40 °C) requires the presence of a nucleating agent – a solid particle that facilitates the freezing process – such as clay mineral dust, soot or bacteria. In a computer simulation, the presence of such ice nucleating agents does not necessarily alleviate the difficulties associated with forming ice on accessible timescales. Nevertheless, in this work we present results from molecular dynamics simulations in which we systematically compare homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation, using the atmospherically important clay mineral kaolinite as our model ice nucleating agent. From our simulations, we do indeed find that kaolinite is an excellent ice nucleating agent but that contrary to conventional thought, non-basal faces of ice can nucleate at the basal face of kaolinite. We see that in the liquid phase, the kaolinite surface has a drastic effect on the density profile of water, with water forming a dense, tightly bound first contact layer. Monitoring the time evolution of the water density reveals that changes away from the interface may play an important role in the nucleation mechanism. The findings from this work suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleating agents may not only enhance the ice nucleation rate, but also alter the macroscopic structure of the ice crystals that form.},

This nucleation mechanism is thought to occur rapidly at −5° to −20°C on substrate particles wetted by water. This hypothesis is based on analysis of the rates of ice crystal formation and ice nucleus activities observed in experiments previously conducted in a 1-m3 isothermal cloud chamber using chemical kinetics. These experiments examined the chemistry of wetted AgI colloid particles involving electric charge separations between the particles and adjacent solution. The rate of nucleation is slowed by the presence of alkali and alkaline earth halides in concentrations greater than approximately 10−3 M in the water wetting the particles. Match of the crystal structure of the substrate with that of the ice may have no effect on this mechanism.},

In many regions of the world, traditional sources and supplies of ground water, rivers and reservoirs, are either inadequate or under threat from ever-increasing demands on water from changes in land use and growing populations. This has prompted scientists and engineers to explore the possibility of augmenting water supplies by means of cloud seeding. This paper provides an overview of the current scientific status of weather modification activities to enhance precipitation for both glaciogenic and hygroscopic seeding experiments. It is important to emphasize that although funding for scientific studies has decreased substantially during the past decade, operational programs have actually increased. During the last 10 years there has been a thorough scrutiny of past experiments involving experiments using glaciogenic seeding. Although there still exist indications that seeding can increase precipitation, a number of recent studies have questioned many of the positive results, weakening the scientific credibility. As a result, considerable skepticism exists as to whether these methods provides a cost-effective means for increasing precipitation for water resources. Recent results from hygroscopic seeding experiments provided for some renewed optimism in the field of precipitation enhancement. Although promising results have been obtained to date, some fundamental questions remain that need to be answered in order to provide a sound scientific basis for this technology.},

It has been suggested that an increase in the ice nucleation ability of aged soot results from an increase in the hydrophilicity of the surfaces upon oxidation. Oxidation, however, also impacts the nanostructure of soot, making it difficult to assess the separate effects of soot nanostructure and hydrophilicity in experiments. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of changes in hydrophilicity of model graphitic surfaces on the freezing temperature of ice. Our results indicate that the hydrophilicity of the surface is not in general a good predictor of ice nucleation ability. We find a correlation between the ability of a surface to promote nucleation of ice and the layering of liquid water at the surface. The results of this work suggest that ordering of liquid water in contact with the surface plays an important role in the heterogeneous ice nucleation mechanism.},

Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semi-empirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and x-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (SCD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC, and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipids systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

In the case of nucleation of solid from liquid (freezing) the situation is much less clear-cut. We have therefore carried out a study of the freezing of 50 ?m diameter water drops on silicon, glass, and mica substrates and made quantitative comparisons for smooth substrates and those roughened by scratching with three diamond powders of different size distributions. In all cases, freezing occurred close to the expected homogeneous freezing temperature, and the nucleation rates were within the range of literature data. Surface roughening had no experimentally significant effect on any of the substrates studied. In particular, surface roughening of mica?which has been shown to cause dramatic differences in crystal nucleation from organic vapors?has an insignificant effect on ice nucleation from supercooled water. The results also show that glass, silicon, and mica have at best only a marginal ice-nucleating capability which does not differ appreciably between the substrates. The lack of effect of roughness on freezing can be rationalized in terms of the relative magnitudes of interfacial free energies and the lack of a viable two-step mechanism, which allows vapor nucleation to proceed via a liquid intermediate.},

We conducted classical molecular dynamics simulations of nanoconfined water under shear between the hydroxyl basal planes of two kaolinite substrates to study the structural and dynamic properties of the nanoconfined water as a function of the amount of water in the system and the applied load. We found that the orientation of the water molecules within the first monolayer (?3 Å) of the kaolinite interfaces changes as a function of load on the system. At low loads, the majority of the water molecules are oriented with one OH bond parallel to the kaolinite interface and the hydrogen atom of the other OH bond nearer to the kaolinite interface and a smaller population of water molecules are oriented with both hydrogen atoms further from the interface than the oxygen atom. At higher loads, while the same orientations are observed, another population of water molecules are oriented with one OH bond parallel to the interface and one OH bond in which the oxygen atom is nearest to the kaolinite interface is observed. The maximum value of viscosity observed is only 1 order of magnitude larger than the bulk shear viscosity at the same pressure.},

Water nanodroplets were deposited on the surfaces and microscopic contact angle was determined from a droplet profile. In case of the octahedral surface the nanodroplet was spread on the surface forming an incomplete monomolecular layer. Multiple, relatively strong hydrogen bonds of the water layer with the surface hydroxyl groups are responsible for the spreading. The contact angle for the octahedral surface is equal zero, thus this surface is strongly hydrophilic. In case of the tetrahedral surface water molecules of the droplet stayed together forming a deformed sphere on the surface. The computed microscopic contact angle is about 105° meaning that the tetrahedral surface is hydrophobic. In spite of weak interactions of the droplet with this surface the water in the vicinity of the surface is structured and ordered into a form of monomolecular water layers with altering density what reflects a polarization effect of the surface. The experimental values of contact angle for kaolinite are about 20° which indicates that the overall character of the kaolinite surface is hydrophilic and our calculations document that a key factor for this property is surface hydroxyl groups of the octahedral surface.},

Geometry optimizations were carried out, and interaction energies between the clay surfaces and the molecular species were computed. Hydrogen bridges between the hydroxyl groups of the octahedral surface and the water molecule were observed with total adsorption energy about ?8 kcal/mol. The carboxylate group of the acetate anion binds to the octahedral surface hydroxyls via hydrogen bridges also. The respective interaction energy amounts to about ?70 kcal/mol.

For the three hydroxide phases studied here, the differences in the structural charge on the octahedral sheet, cation occupancies and distributions, and the orientations of OH groups all affect the surface water structure. The density profiles of water molecules perpendicular to the surface are very similar, due to the prevalent importance of H-bonding between the surface and the water and to their similar layered crystal structures. However, the predominant orientations of the surface water molecules and the detailed two-dimensional near-surface structure are quite different. The atomic density profiles and other structural characteristics of water at the two sheet silicate surfaces are very different, because the talc (0 0 1) surface is hydrophobic whereas the muscovite (0 0 1) surface is hydrophilic. At the hydrophilic and electrostatically neutral brucite and gibbsite (0 0 1) surfaces, both donating and accepting H-bonds from the H2O molecules are important for the development of a continuous hydrogen bonding network across the interfacial region. For the hydrophilic but charged hydrotalcite and muscovite (0 0 1) surfaces, only accepting or donating H-bonds from the water molecules contribute to the formation of the H-bonding network at the negatively and positively charged interfaces, respectively. For the hydrophobic talc (0 0 1) surface, H-bonds between water molecules and the surface sites are very weak, and the H-bonds among H2O molecules dominate the interfacial H-bonding network. For all the systems studied, the orientation of the interfacial water molecules in the first few layers is influenced by both the substrate surface charge and the ability by the surfaces to facilitate H-bond formation. The first layer of water molecules at all surfaces is well ordered in the xy plane (parallel to the surface) and the atomic density distributions reflect the substrate crystal structure. The enhanced ordering of water molecules at the interfaces indicates reduced orientational and translational entropy. In thin films, water molecules are more mobile parallel to the surface than perpendicular to it due to spatial constraints. At neutral, hydrophilic substrates, single-monolayer surface coverage stabilizes the adsorbed water molecules and results in a minimum of the surface hydration energy. In contrast, at the charged and hydrophilic muscovite surface, the hydration energy increases monotonically with increasing water coverage over the range of coverages studied. At the neutral and hydrophobic talc surface, the adsorption of H2O is unfavorable at all surface coverages, and the hydration energy decreases monotonically with increasing coverage.},

The application of high-resolution X-ray scattering techniques has begun to provide substantial new insights into the molecular-scale structure of the mineral–water interface. In this review, we describe the characteristics of synchrotron-based X-ray scattering techniques that make them uniquely powerful probes of mineral–water interfacial structures and discuss the new insights that have been derived from their application. In particular, we focus on efforts to understand the structure and distribution of interfacial water as well as their dependence on substrate properties for major mineral classes including oxides, carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, silicates, halides and chromates. We compare these X-ray scattering results with those from other structural and spectroscopic techniques and integrate these to provide a conceptual framework upon which to base an understanding of the systematic variation of mineral–water interfacial structures.},

We observed five distinguished peaks in the density profile of oxygen present in water, and these peaks are attributable to the water molecules directly adsorbed on mica, hydrated to the K+ ions on the mica surface, and ordered due to hydrogen bonds between hydrated K+ ions. The hydrated K+ ions make an inner-sphere complex and have an explicit first hydration shell with a radius of 3.6 Å and a hydration number of 2.9.

Further increase in confinement leads to a transition to a bilayer ice, whose density is much less than that of ice Ih due to the formation of a specific hydrogen-bonding network.},

The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, ε̇, and ζ, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables ε̇ and ζ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.},

	abstract = {The ice nucleating properties of a number of organic compounds have been investigated. Although many of these lacked the ability to nucleate ice, others showed high activities especially when prepared from melts. Two classes of compounds, steroids and substituted fluorenes were found to include a number of highly active compounds with onset temperatures in the range -2.5°C–5°C. Compounds lacking hydrogen bonding groups were inactive.

From a consideration of those steroid derivatives whose crystal structure has been elucidated, it appears that nucleation is associated generally with the main face (001) and that the essential position for the hydrogen bonding group is at position 3 on ring A of the steroid nucleus, the fit to the prism face of ice related to the dimensions of the steroid molecule.

It has been shown that the array of keto groups on the 010 plane of the high temperature polymorph of fluorenone (onset temperature - 4°C) fits the 0001 plane of ice with a disregistry of about 2 per cent. Another related compound, 9-hydroxymethyl fluoren-9-ol, has been found to nucleate ice at a higher temperature than silver iodide.

Ice nucleation takes place at specific sites which include steps, terraces and shrinkage cracks, and their activity can be explained by the action of suitable surface topography in nullifying the effects of high contact angle and thus permitting the uninhibited growth of ice nuclei.

For cloud seeding purposes, cheap non-toxic substances are preferred, and it has been observed that considerable activity is shown by some hydroxylated graphites, which, like the steroids, withstand the effects of ultraviolet radiation for considerable periods.},

Alginate encapsulation of HepG2 cells enables cell spheroid formation, thus providing sufficient functional biomass. Cryopreservation (CryoP) of these spheroids would allow an off-the-shelf capability for unpredictable emergency use. Cell death during CryoP often results from intracellular ice formation, after supercooling. An ice nucleating agent (INA), crystalline cholesterol, was trialled to reduce supercooling and subsequent cryoinjury. Materials and Methods: Spheroids were cooled in a controlled rate freezer in 12\% dimethylsulfoxide/Celsior +/− INA, and sample temperatures were recorded throughout. Viability was assessed using fluorescent staining with image analysis, cell number by nuclei count, function using assays to detect liver-specific protein synthesis and secretion, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction, and broad-spectrum cytochrome P450 activity. Results: Spheroids cryopreserved without INA displayed latent cryoinjury in the first 6 h after thawing. INA reduced supercooling during CryoP and also latent cryoinjury. Cell numbers, viability, and function as measured over 72 h post-thaw were all improved when INA was present during CryoP.},

MD simulations at constant temperature and volume (statistical NVT ensemble) were performed for a series of model systems consisting of a two-layer muscovite slab (representing 8 crystallographic surface unit cells of the substrate) and 0 to 319 adsorbed H2O molecules, probing the atomistic structure and dynamics of surface aqueous films up to 3 nm in thickness. The results do not demonstrate a completely liquid-like behavior, as otherwise suggested from the interpretation of X-ray reflectivity measurements1 and earlier Monte Carlo simulations.2 Instead, a more structurally and orientationally restricted behavior of surface H2O molecules is observed, and this structural ordering extends to larger distances from the surface than previously expected. Even at the largest surface water coverage studied, over 20\% of H2O molecules are associated with specific adsorption sites, and another 50\% maintain strongly preferred orientations relative to the surface. This partially ordered structure is also different from the well-ordered 2-dimensional ice-like structure predicted by ab initio MD simulations for a system with a complete monolayer water coverage.3 However, consistent with these ab initio results, our simulations do predict that a full molecular monolayer surface water coverage represents a relatively stable surface structure in terms of the lowest diffusional mobility of H2O molecules along the surface. Calculated energies of water adsorption are in good agreement with available experimental data.4},

Used since ancient times for the fabrication of bricks or terracotta, they now find application in the pharmaceutical and plastics industries. They play an essential role in oil and gas recovery, in water availability, and in preventing the dissemination of pollutants. In all of these contexts, the relevant properties of clay minerals are intimately linked to their microscopic structure, which results in a rich behavior with respect to water, solutes, and other fluids. This article provides a brief overview of the structure, dynamics, thermodynamics, and reactivity of water in clays, highlighting the role of the various types of water–mineral interfaces. Based on recent experimental and simulation studies, we discuss several features of these interfacial materials arising from their interactions with water on the molecular scale, including swelling, wetting, hydrodynamics in clay nanopores, reactivity of clay edge sites, ion exchange, and sorption.},

	abstract = {The orientational relaxation dynamics of water confined between mica surfaces is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The study illustrates the wide heterogeneity that exists in the dynamics of water adjacent to a strongly hydrophilicsurface such as mica. Analysis of the survival probabilities in different layers is carried out by normalizing the corresponding relaxation times with bulk water layers of similar thickness. A 10-fold increase in the survival times is observed for water directly in contact with the mica surface and a non-monotonic variation in the survival times is observed moving away from the mica surface to the bulk-like interior. The orientational relaxation time is highest for water in the contact layer, decreasing monotonically away from the surface. In all cases the ratio of the relaxation times of the 1st and 2nd rank Legendre polynomials of the HH bond vector is found to lie between 1.5 and 1.9 indicating that the reorientational relaxation in the different water layers is governed by jump dynamics. The orientational dynamics of water in the contact layer is particularly novel and is found to undergo distinct two-dimensional hydrogen bond jump reorientational dynamics with an average waiting time of 4.97 ps. The waiting time distribution is found to possess a long tail extending beyond 15 ps. Unlike previously observed jump dynamics in bulk water and other surfaces, jump events in the mica contact layer occur between hydrogen bonds formed by the water molecule and acceptor oxygens on the mica surface. Despite slowing down of the water orientational relaxation near the surface, life-times of water in the hydration shell of the K+ ion are comparable to that observed in bulk salt solutions.},

	abstract = {While individual water molecules adsorb strongly on a talc surface (hydrophilic behavior), a droplet of water beads up on the same surface (hydrophobic behavior). To rationalize this dichotomy, we investigated the influence of the microscopic structure of the surface and the strength of adhesive (surface?water) interactions on surface hydrophobicity. We have shown that at low relative humidity, the competition between adhesion and the favorable entropy of being in the vapor phase determines the surface coverage. However, at saturation, it is the competition between adhesion and cohesion (water?water interactions) that determines the surface hydrophobicity. The adhesive interactions in talc are strong enough to overcome the unfavorable entropy, and water adsorbs strongly on talc surfaces. However, they are too weak to overcome the cohesive interactions, and water thus beads up on talc surfaces. Surprisingly, even talc-like surfaces that are highly adhesive do not fully wet at saturation. Instead, a water droplet forms on top of a strongly adsorbed monolayer of water. Our results imply that the interior of hydrophobic zeolites suspended in water may contain adsorbed water molecules at pressures much lower than the intrusion pressure.},

	abstract = {The influence of chemical specificity of hydrophilic surfaces on the structure of confined water in the subnanometer regime is investigated using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The structural variations for water confined between hydroxylated silica surfaces are contrasted with water confined between mica surfaces. Although both surfaces are hydrophilic, our study shows that hydration of potassium ions on the mica surface has a strong influence on the water structure and solvation force response of confined water. In contrast to the disrupted hydrogen bond network observed for water confined between mica surfaces, water between silica surfaces retains its hydrogen bond network displaying bulklike structural features down to surface separations as small as 0.45 nm. Hydrogen bonding of an invariant contact water layer with the surface silanol groups aids in maintaining a constant number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule for the silica surfaces. As a consequence, water depletion and rearrangement upon decreasing confinement is a strong function of the hydrophilic surface specificity, particularly at smaller separations. An oscillatory solvation force response is only observed for water confined between silica surfaces, and bulklike features are observed for both surfaces above a surface separation of about 1.2 nm. We evaluate and contrast the water density, dipole moment distributions, pair correlation functions, and solvation forces as a function of the surface separation.},

In this review, we summarize some of recent advances in the atom-level pictures of the interfacial water, which exhibits the ordered character on various solid surfaces at room or cryogenic temperature. Special focus has been devoted to the wetting phenomenon of “ordered water monolayer that does not completely wet water” and the underlying mechanism on model and some real solid surfaces at room temperature.

Both hydrophilic (hydroxylated) surfaces and hydrophobic surfaces (dehydroxylated upon irradiation) have been generated from atomistic simulations. A new method for the calculation of the normal self-diffusion coefficients based on the calculation of mean first passage times is proposed. It uses the Smoluchowski theory of Brownian motion and it takes proper account of the layering of the molecules. In the case of parallel self-diffusion coefficients, a decrease is found compared to the bulk values. It can be described in terms of hydrodynamic boundary conditions induced by the surface confinement. This hydrodynamic explanation is not enough to interpret the case of normal self-diffusion coefficients for which an important diminution is found. Normal self-diffusion coefficients appear to depend strongly on the hydrophilicity of the surface. They tend towards their bulk value only at long distances from the surfaces. The first layer of water molecules is found to be partially adsorbed.},

Here we show, by using atomic force microscopy and computer simulations, that single hydrated metal ions can spontaneously form ordered structures at the surface of homogeneous solids in aqueous solutions. The structures are laterally stabilized only by ​water molecules with no need for specific interactions between the surface and the ions. The mechanism, studied here for several systems, is controlled by the hydration landscape of both the surface and the adsorbed ions. The existence of discrete ion domains could play an important role in interfacial phenomena such as charge transfer, crystal growth, nanoscale self-assembly and colloidal stability.},

Molecular dynamics simulations of DPPC monolayers using both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic models yield results that are in rough agreement with some of the experimental isotherms, but with a steeper slope in the liquid-condensed region than seen experimentally and shifted to larger areas. The CG lipid model gives predictions that are very close to those of atomistic simulations, while greatly improving computational efficiency. There is much more variation among experimental isotherms than between isotherms obtained from CG simulations and from the most refined simulation available. Both atomistic and CG simulations yield liquid-condensed and liquid-expanded phase area compressibility moduli that are significantly larger than those typically measured experimentally, but compare well with some experimental values obtained under rapid compression.},

Relative to the “fully connected network of H-bonded water molecules” that Odelius et al. found to form “a cage around the potassium ions,” the hydrating arrangements are several tens of meV/H2O better bound.

In this work, the diffusion of the TIP4P-2005 model of water is systematically investigated in liquid phase in the temperature range 210–310 K. The translational and rotational diffusions, as well as correlations between them, are examined. The effects of system size and shape are also probed in this study. The results suggest the presence of a temperature of dynamical arrest of molecular translations in the range of 150–180 K and of molecular rotations in the range of 80–130 K, depending on specific direction. A substantial change in the preferred directions of translations and rotations relative to the molecular coordinate system is observed slightly below (≈15 K) the melting temperature of the model. It is shown that there is a correlation between translational and rotational molecular motions essential for diffusion in the liquid. The presence of hydrodynamic size effects is confirmed and quantified; it is also shown that using a non-cubic simulation box for a liquid system leads to an anisotropic splitting in the diffusiontensor. The findings of this study enhance our general understanding of models of water, specifically the TIP4P-2005 model, as well as provide evidences of the direct connection between thermodynamics of liquid water and dynamics of its molecules.},

The recent discovery of ultrastable glasses that are obtained by depositing the vapor of a glass-forming liquid onto the surface of a cold substrate has sparked renewed interest in the effects of confinements on physicochemical properties of liquids and glasses. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of substrate on thin films of a model glass-forming liquid, the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system, and compute profiles of several thermodynamic and kinetic properties across the film. We observe that the substrate can induce large oscillations in profiles of thermodynamic properties such as density, composition, and stress, and we establish a correlation between the oscillations in total density and the oscillations in normal stress. We also demonstrate that the kinetic properties of an atomic film can be readily tuned by changing the strength of interactions between the substrate and the liquid. Most notably, we show that a weakly attractive substrate can induce the emergence of a highly mobile region in its vicinity. In this highly mobile region, structural relaxation is several times faster than in the bulk, and the exploration of the potential energy landscape is also more efficient. In the subsurface region near a strongly attractive substrate, however, the dynamics is decelerated and the sampling of the potential energy landscape becomes less efficient than the bulk. We explain these two distinct behaviors by establishing a correlation between the oscillations in kinetic properties and the oscillations in lateral stress. Our findings offer interesting opportunities for designing better substrates for the vapor deposition process or developing alternative procedures for situations where vapor deposition is not feasible.},

Adhesion force measurements obtained with chemically modified tips demonstrate that the functionality of the crystal surface can be altered by changes in the solution composition. The 3-hydroxyl end of cholesterol molecules is presented on the plate face in aqueous media, while alkyl tail groups terminate the surface in organic solutions. Contact angle measurements on (001) surfaces exposed to solvents of different hydrophilicity also show similar trends, providing additional support to these AFM assignments. These studies link molecular-level and macroscopic adhesion properties and demonstrate that solution environment can exert a strong influence on the surface properties of this important biomaterial.},

	abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The monohydrated triclinic phase was identified in all the samples by means of X-ray powder diffraction.

	abstract = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (SCD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

	abstract = {A modification of the CHARMM36 lipid force field (C36) for cholesterol, henceforth, called C36c, is reported. A fused ring compound, decalin, was used to model the steroid section of cholesterol. For decalin, C36 inaccurately predicts the heat of vaporization (?10 kJ/mol) and molar volume (?10 cc/mol), but C36c resulted in near perfect comparison with experiment. MD simulations of decalin and heptane at various compositions were run to estimate the enthalpy and volumes of mixing to compare to experiment for this simple model of cholesterol in a chain environment. Superior estimates for these thermodynamic properties were obtained with C36c versus C36. These new parameters were applied to cholesterol, and quantum mechanical calculations were performed to modify the torsional potential of an acyl chain torsion for cholesterol. This model was tested through simulations of DMPC/10\% cholesterol, DMPC/30\% cholesterol, and DOPC/10\% cholesterol. The C36 and C36c results were similar for surface areas per lipid, deuterium order parameters, electron density profiles, and atomic form factors and generally agree well with experiment. However, C36 and C36c produced slightly different cholesterol angle distributions with C36c adopting a more perpendicular orientation with respect to the bilayer plane. The new parameters in the C36c modification should enable more accurate simulations of lipid bilayers with cholesterol, especially for those interested in the free energy of lipid flip/flop or transfer of phospholipids and/or cholesterol.},

An automated parameterization method was used that involves fitting the potential to vibrational frequencies and eigenvectors derived from quantum-chemical calculations. The partial charges were derived by fitting point charges to quantum-chemically calculated electrostatic potentials. To model the dynamics of the hydroxyl groups of the sterols correctly, the parameter set was refined to reproduce the energy barrier for the rotation of the hydroxyl group around the carbon connected to the hydroxyl of each sterol. The frequency-matching plots show good agreement between the CHARMM and quantum chemical normal modes. The parameters are tested in a molecular dynamics simulation of the cholesterol crystal structure. The experimental geometry and cell dimensions are well reproduced. The force field derived here is also useful for simulating other sterols such as the phytosterols sigmasterol, and campesterol, and a variety of steroids. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Indeed, protein nonbonding parameters are chosen in order to obtain a balance between water?water and protein?water interactions and hence a reliable description of protein solvation. However, less attention has been paid to the question of whether the water model provides a reliable description of the water properties under the chosen simulation conditions, for which more accurate water models often exist. Here we consider the case of the CHARMM protein force field, which was parametrized for use with a modified TIP3P model. Using quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical calculations, we investigate whether the CHARMM force field can be used with other water models:? TIP4P and TIP5P. Solvation properties of N-methylacetamide (NMA), other small solute molecules, and a small protein are examined. The results indicate differences in binding energies and minimum energy geometries, especially for TIP5P, but the overall description of solvation is found to be similar for all models tested. The results provide an indication that molecular mechanics simulations with the CHARMM force field can be performed with water models other than TIP3P, thus enabling an improved description of the solvent water properties.},

It is found that irrespective of the temperature the ice-binding surface (IBS) of the protein is relatively more rigid than its nonice-binding surface (NIBS). The presence of a set of regularly arranged internally bound water molecules is found to play an important role in maintaining the flat rigid nature of the IBS. Importantly, the calculations reveal that the strategically located hydroxyl oxygens of the threonine (Thr) residues in the IBS influence the arrangements of five sets of ordered waters around it on two parallel planes that closely resemble the basal plane of ice. As a result, these waters can register well with the ice basal plane, thereby allowing the IBS to preferentially bind at the ice interface and inhibit its growth. This provides a possible molecular reason behind the ice-binding activity of TmAFP at the basal plane of ice.},

	abstract = {Calculations of lipid bilayer permeabilities from first principles, using molecular simulations, would be valuable to rapidly assess the bioavailability of drug candidates, as well as to decipher, at the atomic level, the mechanisms that underlie the translocation of permeants. The most common theoretical approach, the solubility?diffusion model, requires determination of the free energy and the diffusivity as functions of the position of the permeant. Quantitative predictions of permeability have, however, been stymied by acute difficulties in calculating the diffusivity, inadequate sampling, and, most insidiously, systematic biases due to imperfections in the force field, simulation parameters, and the inherent limitations of the diffusive model. In the present work, we combine importance-sampling simulations employing an adaptive biasing force with a Bayesian-inference algorithm to determine the free energy and diffusivity with noteworthy precision and spatial resolution. In multimicrosecond simulations, we probe the sensitivity of the permeability estimates to different aspects of the methodology, including the truncation of short-range interactions, the thermostat, the force-field parameters of the permeant, the time scale over which the diffusivity is estimated, and the size of the simulated system. The force-field parameters and time scale dependence of the diffusivities impose the greatest uncertainties on the permeability estimates. Our simulations highlight the importance of membrane distortion due to the presence of the permeant, which may be partially suppressed if the bilayer patch is not large enough. We suggest that improvements to force fields and more robust kinetic models may be needed to reduce systematic errors below a factor of two.},

Here we show that the ice-nucleating activity of a fungus from the ubiquitous genus Fusarium is related to the presence of nanometre-scale particles which are far more numerous, and therefore potentially far more important for cloud glaciation than whole intact spores or hyphae. In addition, we quantify the ice-nucleating activity of nano-ice nucleating particles (nano-INPs) washed off pollen and also show that nano-INPs are present in a soil sample. Based on these results, we suggest that there is a reservoir of biological nano-INPs present in the environment which may, for example, become aerosolised in association with fertile soil dust particles.},

	abstract = {We report an optimized version of the molecular dynamics program MOIL that runs on a shared memory system with OpenMP and exploits the power of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The model is of heterogeneous computing system on a single node with several cores sharing the same memory and a GPU. This is a typical laboratory tool, which provides excellent performance at minimal cost. Besides performance, emphasis is made on accuracy and stability of the algorithm probed by energy conservation for explicit-solvent atomically-detailed-models. Especially for long simulations energy conservation is critical due to the phenomenon known as “energy drift” in which energy errors accumulate linearly as a function of simulation time. To achieve long time dynamics with acceptable accuracy the drift must be particularly small. We identify several means of controlling long-time numerical accuracy while maintaining excellent speedup. To maintain a high level of energy conservation SHAKE and the Ewald reciprocal summation are run in double precision. Double precision summation of real-space non-bonded interactions improves energy conservation. In our best option, the energy drift using 1fs for a time step while constraining the distances of all bonds, is undetectable in 10ns simulation of solvated DHFR (Dihydrofolate reductase). Faster options, shaking only bonds with hydrogen atoms, are also very well behaved and have drifts of less than 1kcal/mol per nanosecond of the same system. CPU/GPU implementations require changes in programming models. We consider the use of a list of neighbors and quadratic versus linear interpolation in lookup tables of different sizes. Quadratic interpolation with a smaller number of grid points is faster than linear lookup tables (with finer representation) without loss of accuracy. Atomic neighbor lists were found most efficient. Typical speedups are about a factor of 10 compared to a single-core single-precision code.},

	abstract = {Multiple time step (MTS) algorithms present an effective integration approach to reduce the computational cost of dynamics simulations. By using force splitting to allow larger time steps for the more slowly varying force components, computational savings can be realized. The Particle-Mesh-Ewald (PME) method has been independently devised to provide an effective and efficient treatment of the long-range electrostatics interactions. Here we examine the performance of a combined MTS/PME algorithm previously developed for AMBER on a large polymerase β/DNA complex containing 40,673 atoms. Our goal is to carefully combine the robust features of the Langevin/MTS (LN) methodology implemented in CHARMM—which uses position rather than velocity Verlet with stochasticity to make possible outer time steps of 150 fs—with the PME formulation. The developed MTS/PME integrator removes fast terms from the reciprocal-space Ewald component by using switch functions. We analyze the advantages and limitations of the resulting scheme by comparing performance to the single time step leapfrog Verlet integrator currently used in AMBER by evaluating different time-step protocols using three assessors for accuracy, speedup, and stability, all applied to long (i.e., nanosecond) simulations to ensure proper energy conservation. We also examine the performance of the algorithm on a parallel, distributed shared-memory computer (SGI Origin 2000 with 8 300-MHz R12000 processors). Good energy conservation and stability behavior can be demonstrated, for Newtonian protocols with outer time steps of up to 8 fs and Langevin protocols with outer time steps of up to 16 fs. Still, we emphasize the inherent limitations imposed by the incorporation of MTS methods into the PME formulation that may not be widely appreciated. Namely, the limiting factor on the largest outer time-step size, and hence speedup, is an intramolecular cancellation error inherent to PME. This error stems from the excluded-nonbonded correction term contained in the reciprocal-space component. This cancellation error varies in time and introduces artificial frequencies to the governing dynamics motion. Unfortunately, we find that this numerical PME error cannot be easily eliminated by refining the PME parameters (grid resolution and/or order of interpolating polynomial). We suggest that methods other than PME for fast electrostatics may allow users to reap the full advantages from MTS algorithms. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 24: 77–88, 2003},

Our approach has the advantage both of allowing us to explicitly probe intermolecular interactions and of providing insight into the structure of water and lipids around DNA at the lipid interface. We find, by examination of the OD stretch of interfacial D2O, that water structure differs markedly between systems containing DNA adsorbed to cationic and those that contain DNA adsorbed to zwitterionic lipid monolayers (in the presence or absence of Ca2+). The spectral response of interfacial water in the cationic system is consistent with a highly structured, undercoordinated, structural ‘type’ of water. Further, by investigation of CH stretch modes of the diC14-amidine lipid tails, we demonstrate that the adsorption of DNA to this lipid leads to increased ordering of lipid tails.},

	abstract = {We develop an efficient multiple-time-step force splitting scheme for particle-mesh-Ewald molecular dynamics simulations. Our method exploits smooth switch functions effectively to regulate direct and reciprocal space terms for the electrostatic interactions. The reciprocal term with the near field contributions removed is assigned to the slow class; the van der Waals and regulated particle-mesh-Ewald direct-space terms, each associated with a tailored switch function, are assigned to the medium class. All other bonded terms are assigned to the fast class. This versatile protocol yields good stability and accuracy for Newtonian algorithms, with temperature and pressure coupling, as well as for Langevin dynamics. Since the van der Waals interactions need not be cut at short distances to achieve moderate speedup, this integrator represents an enhancement of our prior multiple-time-step implementation for microcanonical ensembles. Our work also tests more rigorously the stability of such splitting schemes, in combination with switching methodology. Performance of the algorithms is optimized and tested on liquid water, solvated DNA, and solvated protein systems over 400 ps or longer simulations. With a 6 fs outer time step, we find computational speedup ratios of over 6.5 for Newtonian dynamics, compared with 0.5 fs single-time-step simulations. With modest Langevin damping, an outer time step of up to 16 fs can be used with a speedup ratio of 7.5. Theoretical analyses in our appendices produce guidelines for choosing the Langevin damping constant and show the close relationship among the leapfrog Verlet, velocity Verlet, and position Verlet variants.},

The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here—a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field.

External routines: GNU libmatheval, Lapack, Blas, MPI.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: This version supersedes the previous version for the most part. There are a small number of very specific situations where the previous version is better, due to performance or to non-ported features. We are actively working on porting these last few features into the new code.

Nature of problem:

Calculation of free-energy surfaces for molecular systems of interest in biology, chemistry and materials science, on the fly and a posteriori analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories using advanced collective variables.

Solution method:

Implementations of various collective variables and enhanced sampling techniques.

Reasons for new version:

The old version was difficult to maintain and its design was not as flexible as this new version. This lack of flexibility made it difficult to implement a number of novel methods that have emerged since the release of the original code.

Summary of revisions:

The new version of the code has a completely redesigned architecture, which allows for several important enhancements. This allows for a much simpler and robust input syntax and for improved performance. In addition, it provides several, more-complex collective variables which could not have been written using the previous implementation. Furthermore, the entire code is fully documented so it is easier to extend. Finally, the code is designed so that users can implement new variables directly in the input files and thus develop bespoke applications of these powerful algorithms.

Unusual features:

PLUMED 2 can be used either as a standalone program, e.g. for a posteriori analysis of trajectories, or as a library embedded in a molecular dynamics code (such as GROMACS, NAMD, Quantum ESPRESSO, and LAMMPS). Interfaces with these particular codes are provided in patches, which a simple script will insert into the underlying molecular dynamics codes source code files. For other molecular dynamics codes there is extensive documentation on how to add PLUMED in our manual.

Additional comments:

The distribution file contains a test suite, user and developer documentation and a collection of patches and utilities.

Running time:

Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. The regression test suite provided takes approximately 1 min to run.},

	abstract = {The electrostatic properties of lipidmembranes are of profound importance as they are directly associated with membrane potential and, consequently, with numerous membrane-mediated biological phenomena. Here we address a number of methodological issues related to the computation of the electrostatic potential from atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers. We discuss two slightly different forms of Poisson equation that are normally used to calculate the membrane potential: (i) a classical form when the potential and the electric field are chosen to be zero on one of the sides of a simulation box and (ii) an alternative form, when the potential is set to be the same on the opposite sides of a simulation box. Both forms differ by a position-dependent correction term, which has been shown to be proportional to the overall dipole moment of a bilayer system (for neutral systems). For symmetric bilayers we demonstrate that both approaches give essentially the same potential profiles, provided that simulations are long enough (a production run of at least 100 ns is required) and that fluctuations of the center of mass of a bilayer are properly accounted for. In contrast, for asymmetriclipid bilayers, the second approach is no longer appropriate due to a nonzero net dipole moment across a simulation box with a single asymmetric bilayer. We demonstrate that in this case the electrostatic potential can adequately be described by the classical form of Poisson equation, provided that it is employed in conjunction with tin-foil boundary conditions, which exactly balance a nonzero surface charge of a periodically replicated multibilayer system. Furthermore, we show that vacuum boundary conditions give qualitatively similar potential profiles for asymmetric lipid bilayers as compared to the conventional periodic boundaries, but accurate determination of the transmembrane potential difference is then hindered due to detachment of some water dipoles from bulk aqueous solution to vacuum.},

	abstract = {Methodological issues in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as the treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions or the type of pressure coupling, have important consequences for the equilibrium properties observed. We report a series of long (up to 150 ns) MD simulations of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers in which the methodology of simulation is systematically varied. Comparisons of simulations with truncation schemes, Ewald summations, and modified Coulomb interactions, either by shift functions or reaction field models, to describe long-range electrostatics point out the artifacts inherent in each of these methods and above all those of straight cutoff methods. We further show that bilayer properties are less sensitive to the details of the pressure-coupling algorithm and that an increased integration time step of 5 fs can be safely used in simulations of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers.},

	abstract = {In this study, the influence of cholesterol on lipid bilayers is investigated by changing phospholipid headgroup, cholesterol concentration, chain saturation, and temperature. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to characterize bilayers containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) head groups with either fully saturated dimyristoyl (DM) or monounsaturated dioleoyl (DO) acyl chains and cholesterol concentrations ranging from 5 to 50\%. To further explore the effects of cholesterol on bilayers with different head groups, we also performed MD simulations of bilayer systems having 15\% cholesterol with phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS), each having DM chains and at a temperature above the solid gel phase transition. Additionally, bilayers of DMPA, DMPE, and DMPS with 15\% cholesterol were simulated at temperatures below the solid gel phase transition temperatures. Compared to membranes without cholesterol, cholesterol in the model bilayers increases chain order in bilayers with the highest order in the liquid ordered and solid gel phases. Head group properties and acyl chain saturation are also found to critically impact bilayer dynamics, largely through the formation of hydrogen bonds between membrane components. These results provide a better understanding of the basic characteristics on structure and dynamics of cholesterol-containing membranes by revealing molecular details of interactions between cholesterol and phospholipids as well as add to the library of simulation data necessary for the MD community to accurately represent relevant models of atomic-scale systems.},

The results of the simulation were compared to those of an analogous system using normal three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. Analysis of the dynamics and electrostatics of the system show that slab geometric periodicity eliminates the artificial bulk water orientational polarization that is present while using normal three-dimensional periodicity. Furthermore, even though the water occupancy and volume of our simple channel is the same when using either method, the electrostatic properties are considerably different when using slab geometry. In particular, the orientational polarization of water is seen to be different in the interior of the channel. This gives rise to a markedly different electric field within the channel. We discuss the implications of slab geometry for the future simulation of this type of system and for the study of channel transport properties.},

We report the first assignment of the vibrational modes in the notoriously congested C–H stretching region of α-pinene and identify its bridge methylene group on the four-membered ring (“βCH2”) as the origin of its dominant spectral feature. We find that the spectra are perfused with Fermi resonances that need to be accounted for explicitly in the computation of vibrational spectra of strained hydrocarbons such as α-pinene. The preferred orientations of α-pinene are consistent with optimization of van der Waals contacts with the silica surface that results in a bimodal distribution of highly fluxional orientations in which the βCH2 group points “towards” or “away from” the surface. Classical molecular dynamics simulations further provide rotational diffusion constants of 49 ± 1 ps and 2580 ± 60 ps, which are attributed to two broad types of adsorption modes on silica. The reported findings are particularly relevant to the exposure of α-pinene to primary oxidants in heterogeneous catalytic pathways that exploit α-pinene as a sustainable feedstock for fine chemicals and polymers.},

This method has been successfully applied in many different fields, ranging from chemistry to biophysics and ligand docking and from material science to crystal structure prediction. We present an important development that speeds up metadynamics calculations by orders of magnitude and renders the algorithm much more robust. We use multiple interacting simulations, walkers, for exploring and reconstructing the same free energy surface. Each walker contributes to the history-dependent potential that, in metadynamics, is an estimate of the free energy. We show that the error on the reconstructed free energy does not depend on the number of walkers, leading to a fully linear scaling algorithm even on inexpensive loosely coupled clusters of PCs. In addition, we show that the accuracy and stability of the method are much improved by combining it with a weighted histogram analysis. We check the validity of our new method on a realistic application.},

In all of our simulations, − 200 bar lateral pressure was found to be enough to rupture lipid membrane regardless of the loading rate or the membrane size. Loading rate and membrane size had a significant impact on rupture. A variety of dynamic properties of lipid molecules, probability distribution of area per lipid particularly, have been determined, and found to be fundamental for describing membrane behavior in detail, thus providing the quantitative description for the requirement of membrane rupture.},

Kaolinite is a clay that is a significant component of airborne particles and is an effective ice nucleus. Despite receiving considerable attention, the microscopic mechanism(s) by which kaolinite nucleates ice is not known. We report molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation by kaolinite (001) surfaces. Both the Al-surface and the Si-surface nucleate ice. For the Al-surface, reorientation of the surface hydroxyl groups is essential for ice nucleation. This flexibility allows the Al-surface to adopt a structure which is compatible with hexagonal ice, Ih, at the atomic level. On the rigid Si-surface, ice nucleates via an unusual structure that consists of an ordered arrangement of hexagonal and cubic ice layers, joined at their basal planes where the interfacial energy cost is low. This ice structure provides a good match to the atomistic structure of the Si-surface. This example is important and may have far-reaching implications because it demonstrates that potential ice nuclei need not be good atomic-level matches to particular planes of ice Ih or cubic ice, Ic. It suggests that surfaces can act as effective ice nuclei by matching one of the much larger set of planes that can be constructed by regular arrangements of hexagonal and cubic ice.},

	abstract = {Kaolinite particles from two different sources (Fluka and Clay Minerals Society (CMS)) were examined with respect to their ability to act as ice nuclei (IN). This was done in the water-subsaturated regime where often deposition ice nucleation is assumed to occur, and for water-supersaturated conditions, i.e., in the immersion freezing mode. Measurements were done using a flow tube (the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator, LACIS) and a continuous-flow diffusion chamber (CFDC). Pure and coated particles were used, with coating thicknesses of a few nanometers or less, where the coating consisted of levoglucosan, succinic acid or sulfuric acid. In general, it was found that the coatings strongly reduced deposition ice nucleation. Remaining ice formation in the water-subsaturated regime could be attributed to immersion freezing, with particles immersed in concentrated solutions formed by the coatings.  In the immersion freezing mode, ice nucleation rate coefficients jhet from both instruments agreed well with each other, particularly when the residence times in the instruments were accounted for. Fluka kaolinite particles coated with either levoglucosan or succinic acid showed the same IN activity as pure Fluka kaolinite particles; i.e., it can be assumed that these two types of coating did not alter the ice-active surface chemically, and that the coatings were diluted enough in the droplets that were formed prior to the ice nucleation, so that freezing point depression was negligible. However, Fluka kaolinite particles, which were either coated with pure sulfuric acid or were first coated with the acid and then exposed to additional water vapor, both showed a reduced ability to nucleate ice compared to the pure particles. For the CMS kaolinite particles, the ability to nucleate ice in the immersion freezing mode was similar for all examined particles, i.e., for the pure ones and the ones with the different types of coating. Moreover, jhet derived for the CMS kaolinite particles was comparable to jhet derived for Fluka kaolinite particles coated with sulfuric acid. This is suggestive for the Fluka kaolinite possessing a type of ice-nucleating surface feature which is not present on the CMS kaolinite, and which can be destroyed by reaction with sulfuric acid. This might be potassium feldspar.},

Below water saturation, both the levoglucosan and H2SO4 coatings similarly reduced the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite particles. Above water saturation, however, only the H2SO4coatings reduced the ice nucleating ability of the particles, particularly at warmer temperatures.

In this instrument, the pure minerals are exposed to water vapor at variable pressures and temperatures. The crystallization of ice on the mineral particles is observed by secondary electron imaging, and the supersaturation for an activated particle fraction of 1–3\% is determined as function of temperature. In all experiments, condensation of water prior to ice formation was not observed within detectable limits, even at water supersaturation. The highest temperatures for 1–3\% activation vary between −10°C and −16°C for the nine minerals investigated, and the corresponding onset relative humidities relative to ice RHi between 107 and 117\%. Supersaturation temperature curves for initial ice formation (1–3\% activation) in the temperature range typical for mixed-phase clouds were measured for all nine minerals. The temperature dependence of the onset relative humidity is strongly dependent on mineralogy. Kaolinite, montmorillonite, and hematite show a strong increase in RHi with decreasing temperature, whereas RHi is almost constant for illite, albite, quartz, and calcite. The highly variable ice nucleation properties of the various mineral dust components should be considered for parameterization schemes.

	abstract = {Nucleation of ice by airborne particles is a process vital to weather and climate, yet our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process is limited. Kaolinite is a clay that is a significant component of airborne particles and is an effective ice nucleus. Despite receiving considerable attention, the microscopic mechanism(s) by which kaolinite nucleates ice is not known. We report molecular dynamics simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation by kaolinite (001) surfaces. Both the Al-surface and the Si-surface nucleate ice. For the Al-surface, reorientation of the surface hydroxyl groups is essential for ice nucleation. This flexibility allows the Al-surface to adopt a structure which is compatible with hexagonal ice, Ih, at the atomic level. On the rigid Si-surface, ice nucleates via an unusual structure that consists of an ordered arrangement of hexagonal and cubic ice layers, joined at their basal planes where the interfacial energy cost is low. This ice structure provides a good match to the atomistic structure of the Si-surface. This example is important and may have far-reaching implications because it demonstrates that potential ice nuclei need not be good atomic-level matches to particular planes of ice Ih or cubic ice, Ic. It suggests that surfaces can act as effective ice nuclei by matching one of the much larger set of planes that can be constructed by regular arrangements of hexagonal and cubic ice.},

	abstract = {A small subset of the atmospheric aerosol population has the ability to induce ice formation at conditions under which ice would not form without them (heterogeneous ice nucleation). While no closed theoretical description of this process and the requirements for good ice nuclei is available, numerous studies have attempted to quantify the ice nucleation ability of different particles empirically in laboratory experiments. In this article, an overview of these results is provided. Ice nucleation "onset" conditions for various mineral dust, soot, biological, organic and ammonium sulfate particles are summarized. Typical temperature-supersaturation regions can be identified for the "onset" of ice nucleation of these different particle types, but the various particle sizes and activated fractions reported in different studies have to be taken into account when comparing results obtained with different methodologies. When intercomparing only data obtained under the same conditions, it is found that dust mineralogy is not a consistent predictor of higher or lower ice nucleation ability. However, the broad majority of studies agrees on a reduction of deposition nucleation by various coatings on mineral dust. The ice nucleation active surface site (INAS) density is discussed as a simple and empirical normalized measure for ice nucleation activity. For most immersion and condensation freezing measurements on mineral dust, estimates of the temperature-dependent INAS density agree within about two orders of magnitude. For deposition nucleation on dust, the spread is significantly larger, but a general trend of increasing INAS densities with increasing supersaturation is found. For soot, the presently available results are divergent. Estimated average INAS densities are high for ice-nucleation active bacteria at high subzero temperatures. At the same time, it is shown that INAS densities of some other biological aerosols, like certain pollen grains, fungal spores and diatoms, tend to be similar to those of dust. These particles may owe their high ice nucleation onsets to their large sizes. Surface-area-dependent parameterizations of heterogeneous ice nucleation are discussed. For immersion freezing on mineral dust, fitted INAS densities are available, but should not be used outside the temperature interval of the data they were based on. Classical nucleation theory, if employed with only one fitted contact angle, does not reproduce the observed temperature dependence for immersion nucleation, the temperature and supersaturation dependence for deposition nucleation, and the time dependence of ice nucleation. Formulations of classical nucleation theory with distributions of contact angles offer possibilities to overcome these weaknesses.},

	abstract = {It is surprisingly difficult to freeze water. Almost all ice that forms under "mild" conditions (temperatures {\textgreater} -40 degrees C) requires the presence of a nucleating agent--a solid particle that facilitates the freezing process--such as clay mineral dust, soot or bacteria. In a computer simulation, the presence of such ice nucleating agents does not necessarily alleviate the difficulties associated with forming ice on accessible timescales. Nevertheless, in this work we present results from molecular dynamics simulations in which we systematically compare homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation, using the atmospherically important clay mineral kaolinite as our model ice nucleating agent. From our simulations, we do indeed find that kaolinite is an excellent ice nucleating agent but that contrary to conventional thought, non-basal faces of ice can nucleate at the basal face of kaolinite. We see that in the liquid phase, the kaolinite surface has a drastic effect on the density profile of water, with water forming a dense, tightly bound first contact layer. Monitoring the time evolution of the water density reveals that changes away from the interface may play an important role in the nucleation mechanism. The findings from this work suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleating agents may not only enhance the ice nucleation rate, but also alter the macroscopic structure of the ice crystals that form.},

Despite the importance of ice formation in determining the properties of clouds, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) was unable to assess the impact of atmospheric ice formation in their most recent report because our basic knowledge is insufficient. Part of the problem is the paucity of quantitative information on the ability of various atmospheric aerosol species to initiate ice formation. Here we review and assess the existing quantitative knowledge of ice nucleation by particles immersed within supercooled water droplets. We introduce aerosol species which have been identified in the past as potentially important ice nuclei and address their ice-nucleating ability when immersed in a supercooled droplet. We focus on mineral dusts, biological species (pollen, bacteria, fungal spores and plankton), carbonaceous combustion products and volcanic ash. In order to make a quantitative comparison we first introduce several ways of describing ice nucleation and then summarise the existing information according to the time-independent (singular) approximation. Using this approximation in combination with typical atmospheric loadings, we estimate the importance of ice nucleation by different aerosol types. According to these estimates we find that ice nucleation below about −15 °C is dominated by soot and mineral dusts. Above this temperature the only materials known to nucleate ice are biological, with quantitative data for other materials absent from the literature. We conclude with a summary of the challenges our community faces.},

	abstract = {Clouds composed of both ice particles and supercooled liquid water droplets exist at temperatures above {\textasciitilde}236 K. These mixed phase clouds, which strongly impact climate, are very sensitive to the presence of solid particles that can catalyse freezing. In this paper we describe experiments to determine the conditions at which the clay mineral kaolinite nucleates ice when immersed within water droplets. These are the first immersion mode experiments in which the ice nucleating ability of kaolinite has been determined as a function of clay surface area, cooling rate and also at constant temperatures. Water droplets containing a known amount of clay mineral were supported on a hydrophobic surface and cooled at rates of between 0.8 and 10 K min−1 or held at constant sub-zero temperatures. The time and temperature at which individual 10–50 μm diameter droplets froze were determined by optical microscopy. For a cooling rate of 10 K min−1, the median nucleation temperature of 10–40 μm diameter droplets increased from close to the homogeneous nucleation limit (236 K) to 240.8 ± 0.6 K as the concentration of kaolinite in the droplets was increased from 0.005 wt\% to 1 wt\%. This data shows that the probability of freezing scales with surface area of the kaolinite inclusions. We also show that at a constant temperature the number of liquid droplets decreases exponentially as they freeze over time. The constant cooling rate experiments are consistent with the stochastic, singular and modified singular descriptions of heterogeneous nucleation; however, freezing during cooling and at constant temperature can be reconciled best with the stochastic approach. We report temperature dependent nucleation rate coefficients (nucleation events per unit time per unit area) for kaolinite and present a general parameterisation for immersion nucleation which may be suitable for cloud modelling once nucleation by other important ice nucleating species is quantified in the future.},

	abstract = {Water density fluctuations are an important statistical mechanical observable that is related to many-body correlations, as well as hydrophobic hydration and interactions. Local water density fluctuations at a solid-water surface have also been proposed as a measure of it’s hydrophobicity. These fluctuations can be quantified by calculating the probability, Pv(N), of observing N waters in a probe volume of interest v. When v is large, calculating Pv(N) using molecular dynamics simulations is challenging, as the probability of observing very few waters is exponentially small, and the standard procedure for overcoming this problem (umbrella sampling in N) leads to undesirable impulsive forces. Patel et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B, 114, 1632 (2010)] have recently developed an indirect umbrella sampling (INDUS) method, that samples a coarse-grained particle number to obtain Pv(N) in cuboidal volumes. Here, we present and demonstrate an extension of that approach to volumes of other basic shapes, like spheres and cylinders, as well as to collections of such volumes. We further describe the implementation of INDUS in the NPT ensemble and calculate Pv(N) distributions over a broad range of pressures. Our method may be of particular interest in characterizing the hydrophobicity of interfaces of proteins, nanotubes and related systems.},

	abstract = {In many clouds, the formation of ice requires the presence of particles capable of nucleating ice. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are rare in comparison to cloud condensation nuclei. However, the fact that only a small fraction of aerosol particles can nucleate ice means that detection and quantification of INPs is challenging. This is particularly true at temperatures above about −20 °C since the population of particles capable of serving as INPs decreases dramatically with increasing temperature. In this paper, we describe an experimental technique in which droplets of microlitre volume containing ice-nucleating material are cooled down at a controlled rate and their freezing temperatures recorded. The advantage of using large droplet volumes is that the surface area per droplet is vastly larger than in experiments focused on single aerosol particles or cloud-sized droplets. This increases the probability of observing the effect of less common, but important, high-temperature INPs and therefore allows the quantification of their ice nucleation efficiency. The potential artefacts which could influence data from this experiment, and other similar experiments, are mitigated and discussed. Experimentally determined heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiencies for K-feldspar (microcline), kaolinite, chlorite, NX-illite, Snomax® and silver iodide are presented.},

Particular interest has focused on thermodynamic response functions that can be described using a normal component and an anomalous component that seems to diverge at about 228 kelvin (refs 1,2,3 ). This has prompted debate about conflicting theories that aim to explain many of the anomalous thermodynamic properties of water. One popular theory attributes the divergence to a phase transition between two forms of liquid water occurring in the /`no man/'s land/' that lies below the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature (TH) at approximately 232 kelvin and above about 160 kelvin, and where rapid ice crystallization has prevented any measurements of the bulk liquid phase. In fact, the reliable determination of the structure of liquid water typically requires temperatures above about 250 kelvin. Water crystallization has been inhibited by using nanoconfinement, nanodroplets and association with biomolecules to give liquid samples at temperatures below TH, but such measurements rely on nanoscopic volumes of water where the interaction with the confining surfaces makes the relevance to bulk water unclear. Here we demonstrate that femtosecond X-ray laser pulses can be used to probe the structure of liquid water in micrometre-sized droplets that have been evaporatively cooled below TH. We find experimental evidence for the existence of metastable bulk liquid water down to temperatures of nature13266-m1jpg11K4520 kelvin in the previously largely unexplored no man/'s land. We observe a continuous and accelerating increase in structural ordering on supercooling to approximately 229 kelvin, where the number of droplets containing ice crystals increases rapidly. But a few droplets remain liquid for about a millisecond even at this temperature. The hope now is that these observations and our detailed structural data will help identify those theories that best describe and explain the behaviour of water.},

It is concluded that homogeneous ice nucleation is responsible for the ice production in these clouds at temperatures below about −33°C. The lack of ice nucleation observed above −33°C indicates a dearth of ice-forming nuclei, and hence heterogeneous ice nucleation, in these clouds. Aircraft measurements in the temperature range −31° to −41°C show the following complement of simultaneous and abrupt changes in cloud properties that indicate a transition from the liquid phase to ice: disappearance of liquid water; decrease in relative humidity from near water saturation to ice saturation; increase in mean particle size; change in particle concentration; and change in temperature due to the release of latent heat. A numerical model of cloud particle growth and homogeneous ice nucleation is used to aid in interpretation of our in situ measurements. The abrupt changes in observed cloud properties compare favorably, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with results from the homogeneous ice nucleation model. It is shown that the homogeneous ice nucleation rates from the measurements are consistent with the temperature-dependent rates employed by the model (within a factor of 10°, corresponding to about 1°C in temperature) in the temperature range −35° to −38°C. Given the theoretical basis of the modeled rates, it may be reasonable to apply them throughout the −30° to −50°C temperature range considered by the theory. The absence of convincing liquid water detection in past in situ cloud studies at temperatures below about −36°C is found to be the result of instrument detection thresholds. Evidence that droplets can exist, under liquid-subsaturated conditions, at temperatures at least as low as −40.7°C is presented. The findings are also used to discuss ice production via homogeneous nucleation in cirrus clouds. Relative humidity measurements from a newly developed airborne cryogenic frostpoint hygrometer were found to be reliable and crucial to studies of homogeneous ice nucleation.},

Droplet freezing was observed during continued simulated adiabatic ascent and cooling to −40°C. Sharply increasing ice nucleation rates were observed between −34° and −39°C, independent of the chemical composition of three CCN used. From the experimental data, nucleation rates are estimated assuming a homogeneous-freezing mechanism. It is concluded that homogeneous-freezing was observed. The results are compared to other laboratory and field studies. These results compare most closely with values calculated from data taken in real clouds and should be relevant to ice formation in cirrus clouds.},

Global estimates of the methane in clathrate hydrate may exceed 1016 kg, which represents one of the largest sources of hydrocarbon on Earth. Speculations about large releases of methane from clathrate hydrate have raised serious but unresolved questions about its possible role in climate change. Progress in our understanding of clathrate hydrate has been made through integrated geophysical and geochemical surveys of known clathrate occurrences. Details from these surveys have motivated new investigations of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that contribute to growth and breakdown of clathrate hydrate in natural settings.

	abstract = {Presented is a review of the radiative properties of ice clouds from three perspectives: light scattering simulations, remote sensing applications, and broadband radiation parameterizations appropriate for numerical models. On the subject of light scattering simulations, several classical computational approaches are reviewed, including the conventional geometric-optics method and its improved forms, the finite-difference time domain technique, the pseudo-spectral time domain technique, the discrete dipole approximation method, and the T-matrix method, with specific applications to the computation of the single-scattering properties of individual ice crystals. The strengths and weaknesses associated with each approach are discussed. With reference to remote sensing, operational retrieval algorithms are reviewed for retrieving cloud optical depth and effective particle size based on solar or thermal infrared (IR) bands. To illustrate the performance of the current solar- and IR-based retrievals, two case studies are presented based on spaceborne observations. The need for a more realistic ice cloud optical model to obtain spectrally consistent retrievals is demonstrated. Furthermore, to complement ice cloud property studies based on passive radiometric measurements, the advantage of incorporating lidar and/or polarimetric measurements is discussed. The performance of ice cloud models based on the use of different ice habits to represent ice particles is illustrated by comparing model results with satellite observations. A summary is provided of a number of parameterization schemes for ice cloud radiative properties that were developed for application to broadband radiative transfer submodels within general circulation models (GCMs). The availability of the single-scattering properties of complex ice habits has led to more accurate radiation parameterizations. In conclusion, the importance of using nonspherical ice particle models in GCM simulations for climate studies is proven.},

However, it is becoming increasingly evident that what has been called cubic ice in the past does not have a structure consistent with the cubic crystal system. Instead, it is a stacking-disordered material containing cubic sequences interlaced with hexagonal sequences, which is termed stacking-disordered ice (ice Isd). In this article, we summarise previous work on ice with stacking disorder including ice that was called cubic ice in the past. We also present new experimental data which shows that ice which crystallises after heterogeneous nucleation in water droplets containing solid inclusions also contains stacking disorder even at freezing temperatures of around −15 °C. This supports the results from molecular simulations, that the structure of ice that crystallises initially from supercooled water is always stacking-disordered and that this metastable ice can transform to the stable hexagonal phase subject to the kinetics of recrystallization. We also show that stacking disorder in ice which forms from water droplets is quantitatively distinct from ice made via other routes. The emerging picture of ice I is that of a very complex material which frequently contains stacking disorder and this stacking disorder can vary in complexity depending on the route of formation and thermal history.},

It is usually obtained in the form of very small crystallites, leading to particle size broadening of the diffraction pattern. This pattern also contains features incompatible with a well-crystallized cubic structure, the details of which depend on the parent phase and the prevailing temperature. We have now corroborated an earlier suggestion (Kuhs et al 1987 J. Physique C1 48 631–6) that an important number of so-called deformation stacking faults exist in cubic ice and propose a model for a quantitative description of stacking faults and anisotropic particle size broadening in ice Ic suitable for profile refinements of its complex diffraction patterns.},

	abstract = {A solid water phase commonly known as “cubic ice” or “ice Ic” is frequently encountered in various transitions between the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of the water substance. It may form, e.g., by water freezing or vapor deposition in the Earth’s atmosphere or in extraterrestrial environments, and plays a central role in various cryopreservation techniques; its formation is observed over a wide temperature range from about 120 K up to the melting point of ice. There was multiple and compelling evidence in the past that this phase is not truly cubic but composed of disordered cubic and hexagonal stacking sequences. The complexity of the stacking disorder, however, appears to have been largely overlooked in most of the literature. By analyzing neutron diffraction data with our stacking-disorder model, we show that correlations between next-nearest layers are clearly developed, leading to marked deviations from a simple random stacking in almost all investigated cases. We follow the evolution of the stacking disorder as a function of time and temperature at conditions relevant to atmospheric processes; a continuous transformation toward normal hexagonal ice is observed. We establish a quantitative link between the crystallite size established by diffraction and electron microscopic images of the material; the crystallite size evolves from several nanometers into the micrometer range with progressive annealing. The crystallites are isometric with markedly rough surfaces parallel to the stacking direction, which has implications for atmospheric sciences.},

To understand the successive transitions when going from metastable recovered high-pressure phases via ice Ic towards the stable ice Ih, as previously observed (Kuhs et al 1989 Z. Kristallogr. 186 174, Kuhs et al 2004 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 6 4917), two samples of deuterated ice Ic from ice IX and ice V have been studied in situ as a function of time at temperatures between 145 and 240 K at the neutron powder diffractometer D20 at ILL. Small changes of stacking fault probability occur hours after formation at about 165 K and continue gradually upon heating towards a higher proportion of hexagonal at the expense of cubic stacking sequences. At 190 K the intensities of the Bragg reflections change considerably and the peaks become sharper. The pattern now increasingly resembles, but does not match exactly, the one of ice Ih until a temperature of about 240 K is reached (Koza et al 2005 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 7 1423). We will show quantitatively the time evolution of stacking disorder and crystallite size at different temperatures for ice Ic of different origin obtained from neutron powder diffraction.

Intracellular water can be transported out of the cell, transferred into its solid phase, or blocked by cryoprotectants and proteins in the cytoplasm. The purpose of the present study is to determine the amount of hydrogen-bonded water in aqueous ethylene glycol and glycerol solutions. The effects of temperature and concentration on the density and the hydrogen bonding characteristics of the solution are evaluated quantitatively in this study. To achieve these aims, a series of molecular dynamics simulations of ethylene glycol/water and glycerol/water mixtures of molalities ranging from 1 to 5 m are conducted at 1 atm and at 273, 285, and 298 K, respectively. The simulation results show that temperature and concentration have variable effects on solution density. The proportion of the hydrogen-bonded water by solute molecules increases with rising molality. The ability of the solute molecules to hydrogen bond with water molecules weakens as the solution becomes more concentrated. Moreover, it turns out that the solution concentration can influence the hydrogen bonding characteristics more greatly than the temperature. The glycerol molecule should be a stronger ?water blocker? than the ethylene glycol molecule corresponding to the same conditions. These findings provide insight into the cryoprotective mechanisms of ethylene glycol and glycerol in aqueous solutions, which will confer benefits on the cryopreservation.},

Comparing aqueous solutions of lysozyme with/without trehalose, we observe that the dynamics of water in the hydration layers close to the protein is dramatically slower when trehalose is present in the system. We also analyze the structure of water and trehalose around the lysozyme and find that the trehalose molecules form a cage surrounding the protein that contains very slow water molecules.

	abstract = {A physicochemical model based on the modified classical heterogeneous nucleationtheory was proposed to analyze the ice formation inside biological cells during freezing. According to this model, intracellular ice formation (IIF) may be catalyzed either by the plasma membrane via the effects of the external ice on the plasma membrane, called surface‐catalyzed nucleation (SCN), or by the intracellular particles, called volume‐catalyzed nucleation (VCN), depending on the freezing conditions. The model for IIF was coupled with the model describing the kinetics of water transport to predict the thermodynamic state of the cytoplasm. A method to estimate the nucleation frequency from the observed probability of nucleation was suggested. This method was based on the assumption that each cell has the same heteronucleating particles with identical properties to alter the nucleation kinetics in an identical way. This allowed the correlation of the experimental probability of IIF with the nucleation rate. It was suggested that the uncertainties in the experimental conditions could be minimized if cells were cooled at rapid rates to prevent water transport during freezing. The model was applied to mouse oocytes at metaphase II. Correlation of the theory with the experimental kinetics of the cumulative fraction of IIF revealed preexponentional factors of 3.56×108 (m2 s)− 1 and 1.84×1050 (m3 s)−1, and exponential factors of 4.6×109 and 1.08×1012 K5 for SCN and VCN, respectively. The contact angle between the internal surface of the plasma membrane and the ice cluster for SCN, θ, was determined to be 35° for freezing in isotonic solutions (285 mosm) increasing linearly to 47° in hypertonic solutions (1035 mosm). SCN was active between ∼−5 and −20 °C in the presence of external ice. It is suggested that the presence of external ice alters the plasma membrane through its chemical, electrical, mechanical, ionic, and thermal effects, to make it an energetically favorable site for heterogeneous nucleation. For VCN, lower and upper limits for θ and R were found to be 60°\&lt;θ\&lt;100° and 10− 7\&lt;R\&lt;4×10− 7 cm, respectively. VCN was active between ∼−30 and −35 °C.},

	abstract = {Successful protocols for cryopreservation of living cells can be designed if the physicochemical conditions to preclude intracellular ice formation (IIF) can be defined. Unfortunately, all attempts to predict the probability of IIF have met with very limited success. In this study, an analytical model is developed to predict ice formation inside mouse oocytes subjected to a freezing stress. According to the model, IIF is catalyzed heterogeneously by the plasma membrane (i.e., surface catalyzed nucleation, SCN). A local site on the plasma membrane is assumed to become an ice nucleator in the presence of the extracellular ice via its effects on the membrane. This interaction is characterized by the contact angle between the plasma membrane and the ice cluster. In addition, IIF is assumed to be catalyzed at temperatures below -30° C by intracellular particles distributed throughout the cell volume (i.e., volume catalyzed nucleation, VCN). In the present study, these two distinctly coupled modes of IIF, especially SCN, are applied to various experimental protocols from mouse oocytes. Excellent agreement between predictions and observations suggests that the proposed model of IIF is adequate.},

An understanding of biomembrane structure-function relations can be based on knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of pure phospholipid bilayers. Here, we have investigated phase transitions in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. We demonstrated the existence of several phase transitions in DPPC and DOPC mica-supported bilayers by both atomic force microscopy imaging and force measurements. Supported DPPC bilayers show a broad Lβ–Lα transition. In addition to the main transition we observed structural changes both above and below main transition temperature, which include increase in bilayer coverage and changes in bilayer height. Force measurements provide valuable information on bilayer thickness and phase transitions and are in good agreement with atomic force microscopy imaging data. A De Gennes model was used to characterize the repulsive steric forces as the origin of supported bilayer elastic properties. Both electrostatic and steric forces contribute to the repulsive part of the force plot.},

	abstract = {Freezing behaviors of egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were quantitatively characterized in relation to freezing temperatures, cooling rates, holding time, presence of sodium chloride and phospholipid phase transition temperature. Cooling of the EPC LUV showed an abrupt increase in leakage of the encapsulated carboxyfluorescein (CF) between −5 °C and −10 °C, which corresponded with the temperatures of the extraliposomal ice formation at around −7 °C. For the DPPC LUV, CF leakage started at −10 °C, close to the temperature of the extraliposomal ice formation; followed by a subsequent rapid increase in leakage between −10 °C and −25 °C. Scanning electron microscopy showed that both of these LUV were freeze-concentrated and aggregated at sub-freezing temperatures. We suggest that the formation of the extraliposomal ice and the decrease of the unfrozen fraction causes freeze-injury and leakage of the CF. The degree of leakage, however, differs between EPC LUV and DPPC LUV that inherently vary in their phospholipid phase transition temperatures. With increasing holding time, the EPC LUV were observed to have higher leakage when they were held at −15 °C compared to at −30 °C whilst leakage of the DPPC LUV was higher when holding at −40 °C than at −15 °C and −50 °C. At slow cooling rates, osmotic pressure across the bilayers may cause an additional stress to the EPC LUV. The present work elucidates freeze-injury mechanisms of the phospholipid bilayers through the liposomal model membranes.},

Supported lipid bilayers are widely used as model systems to study biological membranes. Atomic force microscopy and force spectroscopy techniques are nanoscale methods that are successfully used to study supported lipid bilayers. These methods, especially force spectroscopy, require the reliable preparation of supported lipid bilayers with extended coverage. The unreliability and a lack of a complete understanding of the vesicle fusion process though have held back progress in this promising field. We document here robust protocols for the formation of fluid phase DOPC and gel phase DPPC bilayers on mica. Insights into the most crucial experimental parameters and a comparison between DOPC and DPPC preparation are presented. Finally, we demonstrate force spectroscopy measurements on DOPC surfaces and measure rupture forces and bilayer depths that agree well with X-ray diffraction data. We also believe our approach to decomposing the force-distance curves into depth sub-components provides a more reliable method for characterising the depth of fluid phase lipid bilayers, particularly in comparison with typical image analysis approaches.},

	abstract = {The dissolution of NaCl in water is one of the most common everyday processes, yet it remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report the results of an extensive density functional theory study in which the initial stages of NaCl dissolution have been examined at low water coverages. Our specific approach is to study how the energetic cost of moving an ion or a pair of ions to a less coordinated site at the surface of various NaCl crystals varies with the number of water molecules adsorbed on the surface. This “microsolvation” approach allows us to study the dependence of the defect energies on the number of water molecules in the cluster and thus to establish when and where dissolution becomes favorable. Moreover, this approach allows us to understand the roles of the individual ions and water molecules in the dissolution process. Consistent with previous work we identify a clear preference for dissolution of Cl ions over Na ions. However, the detailed information obtained here leads to the conclusion that the process is governed by the higher affinity of the water molecules to Na ions than to Cl ions. The Cl ions are released first as this exposes more Na ions at the surface creating favorable adsorption sites for water. We discuss how this mechanism is likely to be effective for other alkali halides.},

	abstract = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semi-empirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and x-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (SCD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the SCD for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of 13C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC, and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipids systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

Here, we show for the first time that ab initio molecular dynamics can be used to unravel the connection between the structure of nanoscale water and friction for liquid water in contact with graphene and with hexagonal boron nitride. We find that although the interface presents a very similar structure between the two sheets, the friction coefficient on boron nitride is ≈3 times larger than that on graphene. This comes about because of the greater corrugation of the energy landscape on boron nitride arising from specific electronic structure effects. We discuss how a subtle dependence of the friction on the atomistic details of a surface, which is not related to its wetting properties, may have a significant impact on the transport of water at the nanoscale, with implications for the development of membranes for desalination and for osmotic power harvesting.},

An important consequence, likely to be of relevance to molecular crystals in general, is that transition pressures obtained from density-functional theory exchange-correlation functionals which neglect vdW forces are greatly overestimated.},

The process we investigate, dissociation of a model Na+Cl- ion pair in water, involves a wide range of transition pathways in which collective solvent motions play an important role. Transition states along these pathways encompass a broad distribution of ionic separations. Ion pairs in contact remain associated for ?20 ps on average, a time scale considerably longer than the ?3ps predicted by transition state theory with ionic separation as the order parameter. In contrast to theories of barrier crossing based upon frictional effects (with or without memory), we find that the discrepancy between these time scales arises from neglected solvent free energy barriers rather than stochastic buffeting of the ion pair.},

Employing the forward flux sampling method and the coarse-grained water model (mW), we explicitly computed the heterogeneous ice nucleation rates in the supercooled water on a graphitic surface at various temperatures. The independently calculated ice nucleation rates were found to fit well according to the classical theory for heterogeneous nucleation. The fitting procedure further yields the estimate of the potency factor, which measures the ratio of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier to the homogeneous nucleation barrier. Remarkably, the estimated potency factor agrees quantitatively with the volumetric ratio of the critical nuclei between the heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation. Our numerical study thus provides a strong support to the quantitative power of the theory and allows understanding ice nucleation behaviors under the most relevant freezing conditions.},

This strategy eliminates the need for high concentrations of membrane penetrating solvents such as glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The addition of only 0.1?0.5 wt \% PVA to the polymeric cryoprotectant, HES, significantly enhances cell recovery under conditions that promote damage due to ice recrystallization. The comparative ease with which the addition and removal of both HES and PVA can be attained is an additional attractive quality. Coupled with the benefits attained by the ice recrystallization inhibition activity of PVA, this methodology therefore offers a strategy that could aid the storage and distribution of biological materials.},

By using first-principles calculations, we show that the surface of crystalline ice exhibits a remarkable variance in vacancy formation energies, akin to an amorphous material. We find vacancy formation energies as low as {\textasciitilde}0.1–0.2 eV, which leads to a higher than expected vacancy concentration. Because a vacancy’s reactivity correlates with its formation energy, ice particles may be more reactive than previously thought. We also show that vacancies significantly reduce the formation energy of neighbouring vacancies, thus facilitating pitting and contributing to pre-melting and quasi-liquid layer formation. These surface properties arise from proton disorder and the relaxation of geometric constraints, which suggests that other frustrated materials may possess unusual surface characteristics.},

	abstract = {Clathrate hydrates are solid crystalline structures most commonly formed from solutions that have nucleated to form a mixed solid composed of water and gas. Understanding the mechanism of clathrate hydrate nucleation is essential to grasp the fundamental chemistry of these complex structures and their applications. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an ideal method to study nucleation at the molecular level because the size of the critical nucleus and formation rate occur on the nano scale. Various analysis methods for nucleation have been developed through MD to analyze nucleation. In particular, the mean first-passage time (MFPT) and survival probability (SP) methods have proven to be effective in procuring the nucleation rate and critical nucleus size for monatomic systems. This study assesses the MFPT and SP methods, previously used for monatomic systems, when applied to analyzing clathrate hydrate nucleation. Because clathrate hydrate nucleation is relatively difficult to observe in MD simulations (due to its high free energy barrier), these methods have yet to be applied to clathrate hydrate systems. In this study, we have analyzed the nucleation rate and critical nucleus size of methane hydrate using MFPT and SP methods from data generated by MD simulations at 255 K and 50 MPa. MFPT was modified for clathrate hydrate from the original version by adding the maximum likelihood estimate and growth effect term. The nucleation rates calculated by MFPT and SP methods are within 5\%, and the critical nucleus size estimated by the MFPT method was 50\% higher, than values obtained through other more rigorous but computationally expensive estimates. These methods can also be extended to the analysis of other clathrate hydrates.},

Here we examine the widely studied model systems of hydrogen on graphene and coronene using a van der Waals inclusive density functional theory approach together with path integral molecular dynamics at 50 K. We find that both van der Waals and quantum nuclear effects work together in a cooperative manner to dramatically reduce the barriers for hydrogen atoms to adsorb. This suggests that the low temperature hydrogenation of graphene is easier than previously thought and in more general terms that the combined roles of van der Waals and quantum tunnelling can lead to qualitative changes in adsorption.},

Since the melting temperature of ice I h for the TIP4P model is now known [E. Sanz, C. Vega, J. L. F. Abascal, and L. G. MacDowell, Phys. Rev. Lett.92, 255701 (2004)], it is possible to use the Gibbs–Duhem methodology [D. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys.98, 4149 (1993)] to evaluate the melting temperature of ice I h for other potential models of water. We have found that the melting temperatures of ice I h for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P models are T = 190 K , 215 K , 146 K , 232 K , 245 K , and 274 K , respectively. The relative stability of ice I h with respect to ice II for these models has also been considered. It turns out that for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP5P the stable phase at the normal melting point is ice II (so that ice I h is not a thermodynamically stable phase for these models). For TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew, ice I h is the stable solid phase at the standard melting point. The location of the negative charge along the H–O–H bisector appears as a critical factor in the determination of the relative stability between the I h and II ice forms. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate the effect upon a coexistence line due to a change in the potential parameters.},

	abstract = {Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are a unique class of proteins that are found in many organisms inhabiting subzero environments and ensure their survival by preventing ice growth in vivo. During the last several years, our laboratory has synthesized functional C-linked AFGP analogues (3 and 5) that possess custom-tailored antifreeze activity suitable for medical, commercial, and industrial applications. These compounds are potent inhibitors of ice recrystallization and do not exhibit thermal hystersis. The current study explores how changes in the length of the amide-containing side chain between the carbohydrate moiety and the polypeptide backbone in 5 influences ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity. Analogue 5 (n = 3, where n is the number of carbons in the side chain) was a potent inhibitor of ice recrystallization, while 4, 6, and 7 (n = 4, 2, and 1, respectively) exhibited no IRI activity. The solution conformation of the polypeptide backbone in C-linked AFGP analogues 4?7 was examined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results suggested that all of the analogues exhibit a random coil conformation in solution and that the dramatic increase in IRI activity observed with 5 is not due to a change in long-range solution conformation. Variable-temperature 1H NMR studies on truncated analogues 26?28 failed to elucidate the presence of persistent intramolecular bonds between the amide in the side chain and the peptide backbone. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on these analogues also failed to show persistent intramolecular hydrogen bonds. However, the simulations did indicate that the side chain of IRI-active analogue 26 (n = 3) adopts a unique short-range solution conformation in which it is folded back onto the peptide backbone, orienting the more hydrophilic face of the carbohydrate moiety away from the bulk solvent. In contrast, the solution conformation of IRI-inactive analogues 25, 27, and 28 had fully extended side chains, with the carbohydrate moiety being exposed to bulk solvent. These results illustrate how subtle changes in conformation and carbohydrate orientation dramatically influence IRI activity in C-linked AFGP analogues.},

The latter correlations are found to be more relevant for a clear distinction between the two systems examined here.

	abstract = {The temperature steers the equilibrium and nonequilibrium conformational dynamics of macromolecules in solution. Therefore, corresponding molecular dynamics simulations require a strategy for temperature control which should guarantee that the experimental statistical ensemble is also sampled in silico. Several algorithms for temperature control have been proposed. All these thermostats interfere with the macromolecule?s ?natural? dynamics as given by the Newtonian mechanics. Furthermore, using a single thermostat for an inhomogeneous solute?solvent system can lead to stationary temperature gradients. To avoid this ?hot solvent/cold solute? problem, two separate thermostats are frequently applied, one to the solute and one to the solvent. However, such a separate temperature control will perturb the dynamics of the macromolecule much more strongly than a global one and, therefore, can introduce large artifacts into its conformational dynamics. Based on the concept that an explicit solvent environment represents an ideal thermostat concerning the magnitude and time correlation of temperature fluctuations of the solute, we propose a temperature control strategy that, on the one hand, provides a homogeneous temperature distribution throughout the system together with the correct statistical ensemble for the solute molecule while, on the other hand, minimally perturbing its dynamics.},

	abstract = {Temperature control algorithms in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are necessary to study isothermal systems. However, these thermostatting algorithms alter the velocities of the particles and thus modify the dynamics of the system with respect to the microcanonical ensemble, which could potentially lead to thermostat-dependent dynamical artifacts. In this study, we investigate how six well-established thermostat algorithms applied with different coupling strengths and to different degrees of freedom affect the dynamics of various molecular systems. We consider dynamic processes occurring on different times scales by measuring translational and rotational self-diffusion as well as the shear viscosity of water, diffusion of a small molecule solvated in water, and diffusion and the dynamic structure factor of a polymer chain in water. All of these properties are significantly dampened by thermostat algorithms which randomize particle velocities, such as the Andersen thermostat and Langevin dynamics, when strong coupling is used. For the solvated small molecule and polymer, these dampening effects are reduced somewhat if the thermostats are applied to the solvent alone, such that the solute?s temperature is maintained only through thermal contact with solvent particles. Algorithms which operate by scaling the velocities, such as the Berendsen thermostat, the stochastic velocity rescaling approach of Bussi and co-workers, and the Nosé-Hoover thermostat, yield transport properties that are statistically indistinguishable from those of the microcanonical ensemble, provided they are applied globally, i.e. coupled to the system?s kinetic energy. When coupled to local kinetic energies, a velocity scaling thermostat can have dampening effects comparable to a velocity randomizing method, as we observe when a massive Nose-Hoover coupling scheme is used to simulate water. Correct dynamical properties, at least those studied in this paper, are obtained with the Berendsen thermostat applied globally, despite the fact that it yields the wrong kinetic energy distribution.},

Despite the many studies that have been performed on clathrate hydrates, the actual molecular mechanism of both their homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation has yet to be fully clarified. Here, by means of molecular simulations, we demonstrate how the interface of hexagonal ice can facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation of methane clathrate hydrate from an aqueous methane solution. Our results indicate an initial accumulation of methane molecules, which promote induction of defective structures, particularly coupled 5?8 ring defects, at the ice surface. Structural fluctuations promoted by these defective motifs assist hydrate cage formation next to the interface. The cage-like structures formed then act as a sink for methane molecules in the solution and enhance the stability and growth of an amorphous nucleus, which can evolve into a hydrate crystal upon annealing. These results are illustrative of how a surface that is structurally incompatible can serve to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation of a new crystalline phase. They should also further our general understanding of the formation of gas hydrates and their critical roles in various industrial and environmental processes, including carbon capture and storage.},

Our results are based on molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point charge model of water. We find that both the SE and SED relations break down at low temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and dynamical heterogeneities (DHs), we also calculate the SE and SED relations for subsets of the 7\% “fastest” and 7\% “slowest” molecules. We find that the SE and SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized phenomena, in contrast with a view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with “fractional” SE and SED relations, Dt∼(τ∕T)−ξt and Dr∼(τ∕T)−ξr, where ξt≈0.84({\textless}1) and ξr≈0.75({\textless}1). We also find that there is a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this decoupling occurs in both the fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. Further, we find that, the decoupling increases upon cooling, but that the probability of a molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations, and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our results suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns originate at a time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DHs are more relevant. Our work also demonstrates that selecting DHs on the basis of translational or rotational motion more strongly biases the calculation of diffusion constants than other dynamical properties such as relaxation times.},

In contrast to anhydrous cholesterol which undergoes a polymorphic crystalline transition at 39 degrees C and a crystalline to liquid transition at 151 degrees C, the closed system of cholesterol monohydrate and water exhibited three reversible endothermic transitions at 86, 123, and 157 degrees C. At 86 degrees C, cholesterol monohydrate loses its water of hydration, forming the high temperature polymorph of anhydrous cholesterol. At least 24 hours were required for re-hydration of cholesterol and the rate of hydration was dependent on the polymorphic crystalline form of anhydrous cholesterol. At 123 degrees C, anhydrous crystalline cholesterol in the presence of excess water undergoes a sharp transition to a birefringent liquid crystalline phase of smectic texture. The x-ray diffraction pattern obtained from this phase contained two sharp low-angle reflections at 37.4 and 18.7 A and a diffuse wide-angle reflection centered at 5.7 A, indicating a layered smectic type of liquid crystalline structure with each layer being two cholesterol molecules thick. The liquid crystalline phase is stable over the temperature range of 123 to 157 degrees C before melting to a liquid dispersed in water. The observation of a smectic liquid crystalline phase for hydrated cholesterol correlates with its high surface activity and helps to explain its ability to exist in high concentrations in biological membranes.},

For water simulated with two different potentials, TIP5P and ST2, we find that the temperature of the decoupling of diffusion and alpha relaxation correlates with the temperature of the maximum in specific heat that corresponds to crossing the Widom line T W(P). Specifically, we find that our results for Dτα/T collapse onto a single “master curve” if temperature is replaced by T − T W(P). We further find that the size of the mobile molecule clusters (dynamical heterogeneities) increases sharply near T W(P). Moreover, our calculations of mobile particle cluster size {\textless}n(t*){\textgreater}w for different pressures, where t* is the time for which the mobile particle cluster size is largest, also collapse onto a single master curve if T is replaced by T − T W(P). The crossover to a more locally structured low density liquid (LDL) as T → T W(P) appears to be well correlated both with the breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation and with the growth of dynamic heterogeneities.

	abstract = {Crystalline nucleation of cholesterol at the air-water interface has been studied via grazing incidence x-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation. The various stages of cholesterol molecular assembly from monolayer to three bilayers incorporating interleaving hydrogen-bonded water layers in a monoclinic cholesterol·H2O phase, has been monitored and their structures characterized to near atomic resolution. Crystallographic evidence is presented that this multilayer phase is similar to that of a reported metastable cholesterol phase of undetermined structure obtained from bile before transformation to the triclinic phase of cholesterol·H2O, the thermodynamically stable macroscopic form. According to grazing incidence x-ray diffraction measurements and crystallographic data, a transformation from the monoclinic film structure to a multilayer of the stable monohydrate phase involves, at least initially, an intralayer cholesterol rearrangement in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transition. The preferred nucleation of the monoclinic phase of cholesterol·H2O followed by transformation to the stable monohydrate phase may be associated with an energetically more stable cholesterol bilayer arrangement of the former and a more favorable hydrogen-bonding arrangement of the latter. The relevance of this nucleation process of cholesterol monohydrate to pathological crystallization of cholesterol from cell biomembranes is discussed.},

To obtain pure hexagonal silicon is a great challenge because it naturally crystallizes in the cubic structure. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of pure and stable hexagonal silicon evidenced by structural characterization. In our approach, we transfer the hexagonal crystal structure from a template hexagonal gallium phosphide nanowire to an epitaxially grown silicon shell, such that hexagonal silicon is formed. The typical ABABAB... stacking of the hexagonal structure is shown by aberration-corrected imaging in transmission electron microscopy. In addition, X-ray diffraction measurements show the high crystalline purity of the material. We show that this material is stable up to 9 GPa pressure. With this development, we open the way for exploring its optical, electrical, superconducting, and mechanical properties.},

We find that the position of a rotational heterogeneity is strongly correlated with the position of a translational heterogeneity, and that the fraction of molecules belonging to both kinds of heterogeneities increases with decreasing temperature.

	abstract = {Gas clathrate hydrates were first identified in 1810 by Sir Humphrey Davy. However, it is believed that other scientists, including Priestley, may have observed their existence before this date. They are solid crystalline inclusion compounds consisting of polyhedral water cavities which enclathrate small gas molecules. Natural gas hydrates are important industrially because the occurrence of these solids in subsea gas pipelines presents high economic loss and ecological risks, as well as potential safety hazards to exploration and transmission personnel. On the other hand, they also have technological importance in separation processes, fuel transportation and storage. They are also a potential fuel resource because natural deposits of predominantly methane hydrate are found in permafrost and continental margins. To progress with understanding and tackling some of the technological challenges relating to natural gas hydrate formation, inhibition and decomposition one needs to develop a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. This fundamental understanding is also important to the broader field of inclusion chemistry. The present article focuses on the application of a range of physico-chemical techniques and approaches for gaining a fundamental understanding of natural gas hydrate formation, decomposition and inhibition. This article is complementary to other reviews in this field, which have focused more on the applied, engineering and technological aspects of clathrate hydrates.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, ice I was considered to exist in two well-defined crystalline forms at ambient pressure: stable hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and metastable cubic ice (ice Ic). However, it is becoming increasingly evident that what has been called cubic ice in the past does not have a structure consistent with the cubic crystal system. Instead, it is a stacking-disordered material containing cubic sequences interlaced with hexagonal sequences, which is termed stacking-disordered ice (ice Isd). In this article, we summarise previous work on ice with stacking disorder including ice that was called cubic ice in the past. We also present new experimental data which shows that ice which crystallises after heterogeneous nucleation in water droplets containing solid inclusions also contains stacking disorder even at freezing temperatures of around −15 °C. This supports the results from molecular simulations, that the structure of ice that crystallises initially from supercooled water is always stacking-disordered and that this metastable ice can transform to the stable hexagonal phase subject to the kinetics of recrystallization. We also show that stacking disorder in ice which forms from water droplets is quantitatively distinct from ice made via other routes. The emerging picture of ice I is that of a very complex material which frequently contains stacking disorder and this stacking disorder can vary in complexity depending on the route of formation and thermal history.},

However, many criteria used so far to determine the set of rings to count have serious drawbacks. Here, a ‘‘shortest-path’’ (SP) criterion is shown to give ring statistics that agree well with intuition, and to avoid problems inherent in other criteria. The SP criterion arises naturally in a hierarchy of criteria for ‘‘irreducible’’ rings. It falls exactly midway between the least restrictive and most restrictive criteria in the hierarchy, suggesting that it may give the optimal balance between the two extremes. Since SP rings are simple to characterize and enumerate, SP ring statistics appear to be the most promising means for characterizing network topology.},

We report that positively charged surfaces of pyroelectric LiTaO3 crystals and SrTiO3 thin films promote ice nucleation, whereas the same surfaces when negatively charged reduce the freezing temperature. Accordingly, droplets of water cooled down on a negatively charged LiTaO3 surface and remaining liquid at –11°C freeze immediately when this surface is heated to –8°C, as a result of the replacement of the negative surface charge by a positive one. Furthermore, powder x-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the freezing on the positively charged surface starts at the solid/water interface, whereas on a negatively charged surface, ice nucleation starts at the air/water interface.
Supercooled water on a surface can freeze upon heating in response to surface charge switching from negative to positive.

What is not clear is the mechanism or route by which an external ice crystal can traverse the plasma membrane and cause the heterogeneous nucleation of the supercooled solution within the cell. We have hypothesized that one route is through preexisting pores in aquaporin (AQP) proteins that span the plasma membranes of many cell types. Since the plasma membrane of mature mouse oocytes expresses little AQP, we compared the ice nucleation temperature of native oocytes with that of oocytes induced to express AQP1 and AQP3. The oocytes were suspended in 1.0 M ethylene glycol in PBS for 15 minutes, cooled in a Linkam cryostage to –7.0 °C, induced to freeze externally, and finally cooled at 20 °C/min to –70 °C. IIF that occurred during the 20 °C/min cooling is manifested by abrupt black flashing. The mean IIF temperatures for native oocytes, for oocytes sham injected with water, for oocytes expressing AQP1, and for those expressing AQP3 were –34, –40, –35, and –25 °C, respectively. The fact that the ice nucleation temperature of oocytes expressing AQP3 was 10° to 15° C higher than the others is consistent with our hypothesis. AQP3 pores can supposedly be closed by low pH or by treatment with double-stranded AQP3 RNA. However, when morulae were subjected to such treatments, the IIF temperature still remained high. A possible explanation is suggested.},

	abstract = {Nosé has modified Newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical and the isothermal-isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an N-body system. He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with V1/D in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, ε̇, and ζ, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables ε̇ and ζ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.},

We recently showed that a faithful treatment of such nanoscale interfaces requires careful attention to the statistics of capillary waves, with significant quantitative implications for the calculation of solvation thermodynamics. Here, we show that a coarse-grained lattice model like that of Chandler [Chandler D (2005) Nature 437(7059):640–647], when informed by this understanding, can capture a broad range of hydrophobic behaviors with striking accuracy. Specifically, we calculate probability distributions for microscopic density fluctuations that agree very well with results of atomistic simulations, even many SDs from the mean and even for probe volumes in highly heterogeneous environments. This accuracy is achieved without adjustment of free parameters, because the model is fully specified by well-known properties of liquid water. As examples of its utility, we compute the free-energy profile for a solute crossing the air–water interface, as well as the thermodynamic cost of evacuating the space between extended nanoscale surfaces. These calculations suggest that a highly reduced model for aqueous solvation can enable efficient multiscale modeling of spatial organization driven by hydrophobic and interfacial forces.},

However, the microscopic details of ice nucleation on these substances remain largely unknown. Here, we have unraveled the molecular mechanism and the kinetics of ice formation on kaolinite, a clay mineral playing a key role in climate science. We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous freezing. The critical nucleus is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface. Kaolinite also promotes the exclusive nucleation of hexagonal ice, as opposed to homogeneous freezing where a mixture of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is observed.},

These microorganisms efficiently catalyze ice formation at temperatures much higher than most organic or inorganic substances. Because of their ubiquity on the surfaces of frost-sensitive plants, they are responsible for initiating ice formation, which results in frost injury. The high temperature of ice catalysis conferred by bacterial ice nuclei makes them useful in ice nucleation-limited processes such as artificial snow production, the freezing of some food products, and possibly in future whether modification schemes. The rarity of other ice nuclei active at high subfreezing temperature, and the ease and sensitivity with which ice nuclei can be quantified, have made the use of a promoterless bacterial ice nucleation gene valuable as a reporter of transcription. Target genes to which this promoter is fused can be used in cells in natural habitats. Warm-temperature ice nucleation sites have also been extensively studied at a molecular level. Nucleation sites active at high temperatures (above -5 degrees C) are probably composed of bacterial ice nucleation protein molecules that form functionally aligned aggregates. Models of ice nucleation proteins predict that they form a planar array of hydrogen binding groups that closely complement that of an ice crystal face. Moreover, interdigitation of these molecules may produce a large contiguous template for ice formation.},

Here, we present a novel model of an INP structure from Pseudomonas syringae based on comparison with two newly determined insect AFP structures. The results suggest that both this class of AFPs and INPs may have a similar β-helical fold and that they could interact with water through the repetitive TXT motif. By theoretical arguments, we show that the distinguishing feature between an ice inhibitor and an ice nucleator lies in the size of the ice-interacting surface. For INPs, the larger surface area acts as a template that is larger than the critical ice embryo surface area required for growth. In contrast, AFPs are small enough so that they bind to ice and inhibit further growth without acting as a nucleator.},

However, our knowledge regarding the diversity of bacterial IBPs is limited; few studies have purified and characterized AFPs and INPs from bacteria. Phenotypically verified IBPs have been described in members belonging to Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Flavobacteriia classes, whereas putative IBPs have been found in Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacilli classes. Thus, the main goal of this minireview is to summarize the current information on bacterial IBPs and their application in biotechnology, emphasizing the potential application in less explored fields such as agriculture. Investigations have suggested the use of INP-producing bacteria antagonists and AFPs-producing bacteria (or their AFPs) as a very attractive strategy to prevent frost damages in crops. UniProt database analyses of reported IBPs (phenotypically verified) and putative IBPs also show the limited information available on bacterial IBPs and indicate that major studies are required.},

With their ability to induce ice formation at temperatures just below the ice melting point, bacteria such as Pseudomonas syringae attack plants through frost damage using specialized ice-nucleating proteins. Besides the impact on agriculture and microbial ecology, airborne P. syringae can affect atmospheric glaciation processes, with consequences for cloud evolution, precipitation, and climate. Biogenic ice nucleation is also relevant for artificial snow production and for biomimetic materials for controlled interfacial freezing. We use interface-specific sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to show that hydrogen bonding at the water-bacteria contact imposes structural ordering on the adjacent water network. Experimental SFG data and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that ice-active sites within P. syringae feature unique hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterns to enhance ice nucleation. The freezing transition is further facilitated by the highly effective removal of latent heat from the nucleation site, as apparent from time-resolved SFG spectroscopy.
Specialized bacteria trigger ice formation by controlling the molecular structure and energy transfer in interfacial water.

	abstract = {Ice formation is ubiquitous in nature, with important consequences in a variety of environments, including biological cells, soil, aircraft, transportation infrastructure, and atmospheric clouds. However, its intrinsic kinetics and microscopic mechanism are difficult to discern with current experiments. Molecular simulations of ice nucleation are also challenging, and direct rate calculations have only been performed for coarse-grained models of water. For molecular models, only indirect estimates have been obtained, e.g., by assuming the validity of classical nucleation theory. We use a path sampling approach to perform, to our knowledge, the first direct rate calculation of homogeneous nucleation of ice in a molecular model of water. We use TIP4P/Ice, the most accurate among existing molecular models for studying ice polymorphs. By using a novel topological approach to distinguish different polymorphs, we are able to identify a freezing mechanism that involves a competition between cubic and hexagonal ice in the early stages of nucleation. In this competition, the cubic polymorph takes over because the addition of new topological structural motifs consistent with cubic ice leads to the formation of more compact crystallites. This is not true for topological hexagonal motifs, which give rise to elongated crystallites that are not able to grow. This leads to transition states that are rich in cubic ice, and not the thermodynamically stable hexagonal polymorph. This mechanism provides a molecular explanation for the earlier experimental and computational observations of the preference for cubic ice in the literature.},

The histogram test, based on estimated committor probabilities, is often used as a qualitative indicator for good reaction coordinates. This paper derives the mean and variance of the intrinsic committor distribution in terms of the mean and variance of the histogram of committor estimates. These convenient formulas enable the first quantitative calculations of reaction coordinate error for complex systems. An example shows that the approximate transition state surface from Peters’ and Trout’s reaction coordinate for nucleation in the Ising model gives a mean committor probability of 0.495 and a standard deviation of 0.042.},

The new method screens a set of candidate collective variables for a good reaction coordinate that depends on a few relevant variables. The Bayesian information criterion determines whether additional variables significantly improve the reaction coordinate. Additionally, we present an advantageous transition path sampling algorithm and an algorithm to generate the most likely transition path in the space of collective variables. The method is demonstrated on two systems: a bistable modelpotential energy surface and nucleation in the Ising model. For the Ising model of nucleation, we quantify for the first time the role of nuclei surface area in the nucleationreaction coordinate.

In this paper, we discuss the theoretical background and algorithmic details of the finite-temperature string method, as well as the application to the study of isomerization reaction of the alanine dipeptide, both in vacuum and in explicit solvent. We demonstrate that the method allows us to identify directly the isocommittor surfaces, which are approximated by hyperplanes, in the region of configuration space where the most probable transition trajectories are concentrated. These results are verified subsequently by computing directly the committor distribution on the hyperplanes that define the transition state region.},

However, an aggregation of water molecules will naturally give rise to a collective chirality. Such homochiral domains possess obvious topological and geometrical orders and are energetically more stable than the average. However, homochiral domains cannot grow into macroscopic homogeneous structures due to geometrical frustrations arising from their icosahedral local order. Homochiral domains are the major constituent of supercooled liquid water and the origin of heterogeneity in that substance, and are expected to be enhanced in low-density amorphous ice at lower temperatures.},

First, the relative effects of warming and cooling rates on the survival of mouse oocytes subjected to a vitrification procedure were determined. The high sensitivity to warming rate strongly suggests that the lethality of slow warming is a consequence of either the crystallisation of intracellular glassy water during warming or the recrystallisation during slow warming of small intracellular crystals that had formed during cooling. Warming rates of 107°C min–1 were achieved in 0.1-µL drops of ethylene glycol–acetamide–Ficoll–sucrose (EAFS) solution plus a small amount of India ink on Cryotops warmed using an infrared laser pulse. Under these conditions, survival rates of 90\% were obtained even when mouse oocytes were suspended in 0.3× EAFS, a concentration that falls in the range that many cells can tolerate. A second important finding was that the survival of oocytes is more dependent on the osmotic withdrawal of much of the intracellular water before vitrification than it is on the penetration of cryoprotective solutes into the cells.

	abstract = {The occurrence of intracellular ice formation (IIF) is the most important factor determining whether cells survive a cryopreservation procedure. What is not clear is the mechanism or route by which an external ice crystal can traverse the plasma membrane and cause the heterogeneous nucleation of the supercooled solution within the cell. We have hypothesized that one route is through preexisting pores in aquaporin (AQP) proteins that span the plasma membranes of many cell types. Since the plasma membrane of mature mouse oocytes expresses little AQP, we compared the ice nucleation temperature of native oocytes with that of oocytes induced to express AQP1 and AQP3. The oocytes were suspended in 1.0 M ethylene glycol in PBS for 15 min, cooled in a Linkam cryostage to −7.0 °C, induced to freeze externally, and finally cooled at 20 °C/min to −70 °C. IIF that occurred during the 20 °C/min cooling is manifested by abrupt black flashing. The mean IIF temperatures for native oocytes, for oocytes sham injected with water, for oocytes expressing AQP1, and for those expressing AQP3 were −34, −40, −35, and −25 °C respectively. The fact that the ice nucleation temperature of oocytes expressing AQP3 was 10–15 °C higher than the others is consistent with our hypothesis. AQP3 pores can supposedly be closed by low pH or by treatment with double-stranded Aqp3 RNA. However, when morulae were subjected to such treatments, the IIF temperature still remained high. A possible explanation is suggested.},

Each cryosolvent induced lateral expansion of the membrane leading to thinning of the bilayer and resulting in disordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains. Propylene glycol and DMSO were observed to exhibit a greater disordering effect on the structure of the membrane than the other three alcohols. Closer examination exposed a number of effects on the lipid bilayer as a function of the molecular size and hydrogen bonding capacity of the cryosolvents. Analyses of hydrogen bonds revealed that increased concentrations of the polyhydroxylated cryosolvents induced the formation of a cross-linked cryosolvent layer across the surface of the membrane bilayer. This effect was most pronounced for glycerol at sufficiently high concentrations, which displayed a comparatively enhanced capacity to induce cross-linking of lipid headgroups resulting in the formation of extensive hydrogen bonding bridges and the promotion of a dense cryosolvent layer across the phospholipid bilayer.},

The concentration of DMSO was varied between 0 and 25.0 mol \%. For both lipids, DMSO causes the membrane to expand in the plane of the membrane while thinning normal to that plane. Above a critical concentration, pores in the membrane form spontaneously, and if the concentration is increased further, then the bilayer structure is destroyed. Even at concentrations below those required to induce pores, DMSO readily diffuses across the bilayers. The free-energy profile associated with the diffusion of a DMSO molecules across the membrane has been calculated. The simulations suggest that the DOPC bilayer is more resistant to the deleterious effects of DMSO, both increasing the stability of the membranes and decreasing the rate at which DMSO diffuses across the membrane. In this way, the work highlights the importance of investigating the lipid composition of cell membranes when characterizing the effects of cryosolvents.},

Mazur so that the modified model is capable of predicting cell volumetric change even after intracellular ice formation (IIF). By coupling the modified P. Mazur's model, ice nucleation, and the diffusion-limited ice growth theory, the new model describing IIF and the growth of the intracellular ice (IIG) is developed based on J. O. M. Karlsson's work in 1994. The new model could be used to predict IIF, IIG, the final volumetric fraction of the intracellular ice, and the size distribution of the intracellular ice crystals. The major advantage of the new model is that it can provide reasonable intracellular information for both high cryoprotective agent (CPA) and low CPA concentrations without “Avrami correction”. The new model is then used to study the effect of cooling rate and initial CPA concentration on IIF and IIG. Three interesting phenomena, “hydration of salt ions (Na+ and Cl−)”, “crustaceous vitrification”, and “local vitrification” are presented, and their effects on IIF and IIG are studied in detail. It is found that all three of these factors have significant influences on the predicted critical cooling rate for the vitrification of the intracellular solution. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006},

As the mixing of different lipid species requires long spatio-temporal scales, coarse-grained models have gained increasing application in modeling such membrane systems. In this paper, we characterize the phase diagram of the 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer in the presence of different cholesterol concentrations and at different temperatures using the MARTINI force field in the context of coarse-grained MD simulations. Self-assembled bilayers quantitatively reproduce experimental observables, such as lateral diffusion of lipids, electron density, are per lipid and lipid order parameters. The phase diagram of DPPC-cholesterol binary system indicates the profound effect of cholesterol on the physical properties of phospholipid bilayers in the ordering, condensing and regulating the fluidity of biological membranes. Moreover, cholesterol induces the liquid-ordered phase, which affects phospholipid molecules by increasing the fluidity of the hydrocarbon chains below and decreasing the fluidity above the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature. The MARTINI force is able to quantitatively reproduce the full spectrum of the DPPC-cholesterol phase diagram and the microscopic structure of these phases.},

	abstract = {The temperature steers the equilibrium and nonequilibrium conformational dynamics of macromolecules in solution. Therefore, corresponding molecular dynamics simulations require a strategy for temperature control which should guarantee that the experimental statistical ensemble is also sampled in silico. Several algorithms for temperature control have been proposed. All these thermostats interfere with the macromolecule’s “natural” dynamics as given by the Newtonian mechanics. Furthermore, using a single thermostat for an inhomogeneous solute−solvent system can lead to stationary temperature gradients. To avoid this “hot solvent/cold solute” problem, two separate thermostats are frequently applied, one to the solute and one to the solvent. However, such a separate temperature control will perturb the dynamics of the macromolecule much more strongly than a global one and, therefore, can introduce large artifacts into its conformational dynamics. Based on the concept that an explicit solvent environment represents an ideal thermostat concerning the magnitude and time correlation of temperature fluctuations of the solute, we propose a temperature control strategy that, on the one hand, provides a homogeneous temperature distribution throughout the system together with the correct statistical ensemble for the solute molecule while, on the other hand, minimally perturbing its dynamics.},

	abstract = {Although sperm were successfully cryopreserved in 1950, another 22 years elapsed before the successful preservation of a mammalian embryo. In 1963, I had carried out physical–chemical analyses indicating that if cells were cooled too rapidly, they would undergo lethal intracellular ice formation (IIF), and defined what is meant by “too rapidly” for a particular cell. To avoid IIF, the cell had to dehydrate during cooling, and the required rate of cooling depended chiefly on the permeability of a particular cell to water and on the temperature coefficient of that permeability.

Between 1968 and 1972, Stanley Leibo and I turned our attention to the survival of yeast, mouse marrow stem cells, and Chinese Hamster tissue culture cells as functions of cooling rate and temperature. We found that plots of survival vs. cooling rate formed an inverted “U”, with high survivals at a medium rate, and lower survivals after very slow and very rapid cooling. We proposed a “Two-Factor” hypothesis which stated that the right hand arm of the inverted U was a result of IIF at high cooling rates. Interestingly, the optimum cooling rate for maximum survival varied over a wide range for the different cells. This was chiefly because the cells differed widely in water permeability and the temperature coefficient of that permeability. In fact if the known values of these parameters were used to generate the theoretical curves, the predicted relation between IIF and cooling rate agreed quite closely with the observed drop in survival vs. cooling rate.

In 1971 David Whittingham reported the successful cryopreservation of mouse 8-cell embryos cooled at 50 °C/min in PVP. Leibo and I were excited but perplexed about these results – perplexed because our computations indicated that mouse embryos would undergo lethal IIF when cooled at that rate. We calculated that the cooling rate would have to be about 1 °C/min.. That turned out to be the case. With that change and the substitution of Me2SO for PVP, David, Stanley and I obtained very good in vitro and in vivo survival of 8-cell embryos cooled to −196 °C (or −269 °C). The ability to cryopreserve mouse embryos quickly had important applied consequences and important fundamental consequences. Perhaps, the most important direct application was that it permitted the long-term maintenance of thousands of mutant lines of mice in the form of preimplantation embryos in a few liquid nitrogen tanks. The indirect applications stemmed from the fact that essentially the same procedures worked for early embryos of over 20 other mammals, including humans.

In the last decade, clinical interest has been emphasizing the cryopreservation of human oocytes. They have proved more difficult to freeze and so interest has shifted somewhat to cryopreserving them by vitrification. As discussed, one way to avoid lethal IIF is to cool cells slowly enough so that the freezable water in the cell flows out of the cell and freezes externally. An alternative approach is to avoid intracellular ice by vitrifying cellular water. Vitrification involves converting water into a non-crystalline or amorphous glass. To achieve this conversion, it has been the strong belief that cells have to be in solutions containing a very high concentration of glass-inducing solutes and have to be cooled very rapidly. In recent work, however, we have found that neither of these is true for mouse oocytes. The important factor is not the cooling rate – it is the warming rate, and the warming rate has to be very high. Furthermore, if the warming rate is very high, one can cut in half the concentration of solutes in the vitrification solution and still obtain high survivals.},

It has been proposed that gap junctions facilitate ice propagation between cells. This study develops an equation for capillary freezing-point depression to determine the effect of temperature on the equilibrium radius of an ice crystal sufficiently small to grow through gap junctions. Convection cryomicroscopy and video image analysis were used to examine the incidence and pattern of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in the confluent monolayers of cell lines that do (MDCK) and do not (V-79W) form gap junctions. The effect of gap junctions on intracellular ice propagation was strongly temperature-dependent. For cells with gap junctions, IIF occurred in a directed wave-like pattern in 100\% of the cells below -3 degrees C. At temperatures above -3 degrees C, there was a marked drop in the incidence of IIF, with isolated individual cells initially freezing randomly throughout the sample. This random pattern of IIF was also observed in the V-79W monolayers and in MDCK monolayers treated to prevent gap junction formation. The significant change in the low temperature behavior of confluent MDCK monolayers at -3 degrees C is likely the result of the inhibition of gap junction-facilitated ice propagation, and supports the theory that gap junctions facilitate ice nucleation between cells.},

Two different measures of activity were utilized: the onset temperature of freezing, as determined on a cold stage microscope; and the relative number of ice nuclei formed at a fixed temperature in a cold chamber. Reactivity was generally found to vary with the potential strength of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl or carboxyl group and a water molecule. In a given series of compounds (i.e., either the phenols or the benzoic acids), it was found that the onset temperature could be predicted from the sigma value of Hammett for the individual substituent, so long as the substituent was in the meta and para position, and was not more strongly hydrogen bonding than the functional group of the parent compound. This suggests a free-energy relationship between molecular structure and nucleating power. These observations are offered for further discussion; it is clearly premature to offer a detailed mechanism for the effect.},

As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.},

Here we show, by advanced molecular simulations, that the heterogeneous nucleation of ice on graphitic surface is controlled by the coupling of surface crystallinity and surface hydrophilicity. Molecular level analysis reveals that the crystalline graphitic lattice with an appropriate hydrophilicity may indeed template ice basal plane by forming a strained ice layer, thus significantly enhancing its ice nucleation efficiency. Remarkably, the templating effect is found to transit from within the first contact layer of water to the second as the hydrophilicity increases, yielding an oscillating distinction between the crystalline and amorphous graphitic surfaces in their ice nucleation efficiencies.

Ice nucleated on the Ag exposed surface of AgI disks and plates. Shortly after supercooling an ice cluster forms on the AgI surface. The AgI-stabilized ice cluster fluctuates in size as time progresses, but, once formed, it is constantly present.

We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous freezing. The critical nucleus is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface.

The results of the simulation were compared to those of an analogous system using normal three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. Analysis of the dynamics and electrostatics of the system show that slab geometric periodicity eliminates the artificial bulk water orientational polarization that is present while using normal three-dimensional periodicity. Furthermore, even though the water occupancy and volume of our simple channel is the same when using either method, the electrostatic properties are considerably different when using slab geometry. In particular, the orientational polarization of water is seen to be different in the interior of the channel. This gives rise to a markedly different electric field within the channel. We discuss the implications of slab geometry for the future simulation of this type of system and for the study of channel transport properties.},

It has been proposed that gap junctions facilitate ice propagation between cells. This study develops an equation for capillary freezing-point depression to determine the effect of temperature on the equilibrium radius of an ice crystal sufficiently small to grow through gap junctions. Convection cryomicroscopy and video image analysis were used to examine the incidence and pattern of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in the confluent monolayers of cell lines that do (MDCK) and do not (V-79W) form gap junctions. The effect of gap junctions on intracellular ice propagation was strongly temperature-dependent. For cells with gap junctions, IIF occurred in a directed wave-like pattern in 100\% of the cells below −3°C. At temperatures above −3°C, there was a marked drop in the incidence of IIF, with isolated individual cells initially freezing randomly throughout the sample. This random pattern of IIF was also observed in the V-79W monolayers and in MDCK monolayers treated to prevent gap junction formation. The significant change in the low temperature behavior of confluent MDCK monolayers at −3°C is likely the result of the inhibition of gap junction-facilitated ice propagation, and supports the theory that gap junctions facilitate ice nucleation between cells.},

For use against Milax gracilis Leydig. heaps of bait should not be normally more than 2 yd. apart and against Arion hortensis Fer. not more than 3 ft. apart. The mortality of slugs attracted to metaldehyde-bran baits is dependent on the drying property of the soil and atmosphere around the baits. D.D.T. flea-beetle dust and powdered pyrethrum flowers are sufficiently distasteful to slugs to prevent their consuming a lethal dose of the poison mixed with bran. The addition of 10\%, by volume, of dried blood to metaldehyde-bran bait increases the catch of some slugs under certain conditions but does not increase the mortality. The addition of 10\%, by volume, of dextrose increases the mortality produced by metaldehyde but does not increase the numbers attracted to the bait. A metaldehyde-bran bait compacted into ‘biscuit’ form with anhydrous calcium sulphate catches more slugs than an ordinary metaldehyde-bran bait, but almost completely counteracts the effect of the metaldehyde. A metal-dehyde-bran-casein glue bait in ‘biscuit’ form increases the catch and kill of Milax gracilis and Agriolimax reticulatus Müll., but not of Arion hortensis. Metaldehyde-bran-casein glue bait broadcast in ‘broken biscuit’ form is effective over a longer period, thus producing a greater kill of slugs, than a broadcast metaldehyde-bran bait.},

As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.},

This free-energy change is the hydrophobic solvation energy (ΔGvdw). Frequently, it is assumed to be linear in the solvent-accessible surface area, with a positive surface tension (γ) that is independent of the properties of the molecule. However, we found that γ for a set of alkanes differed from that for four configurations of decaalanine, and γ = −5 was negative for the decaalanines. These findings conflict with the notion that ΔGvdw favors smaller A. We broke ΔGvdw into the free energy required to exclude water from the vdw cavity (ΔGrep) and the free energy of forming the attractive interactions between the solute and solvent (ΔGatt) and found that γ {\textless} 0 for the decaalanines because −γatt {\textgreater} γrep and γatt {\textless} 0. Additionally, γatt and γrep for the alkanes differed from those for the decaalanines, implying that none of ΔGatt, ΔGrep, and ΔGvdw can be computed with a constant surface tension. We also showed that ΔGatt could not be computed from either the initial or final water distributions, implying that this quantity is more difficult to compute than is sometimes assumed. Finally, we showed that each atom’s contribution to γrep depended on multibody interactions with its surrounding atoms, implying that these contributions are not additive. These findings call into question some hydrophobic models.},

In addition, we have studied self-diffusion of single adatoms on the BCC-Fe(1 0 0) surface at several temperatures. The migration energies and pre-exponential factors for three main diffusion mechanisms were determined and compared with available experimental data. We have found that the diagonal exchange diffusion process is energetically favored over the direct hopping mechanism and that its migration energy is close to the experimental value. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient associated with the diagonal exchange diffusion process is about an order of magnitude higher than those of the hopping and the non-diagonal exchange mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Because transition states are too rare and transient to observe in experiments, simulations are among the best sources of molecular-level insight on transition states and reaction mechanisms. A first step in many rare-event simulations is to identify a reaction coordinate. For reactions that break and make strong bonds, the reaction coordinate is the unstable eigenmode at a saddle point on the potential energy surface. However, processes such as nucleation and protein folding may disrupt and reorganise thousands of interactions, so identifying a reaction coordinate is a major challenge. An accurate reaction coordinate should result in a free energy profile that is consistent with the projected dynamics. Ten years ago, this intuitive requirement led to committor analysis, a trial-and-error procedure for testing putative reaction coordinates. Since then, our ability to identify accurate reaction coordinates has dramatically improved. First, new versions of committor analysis are quantitative and more efficient. Second, likelihood maximisation can systematically and efficiently identify accurate reaction coordinates from thousands of candidates using only the shooting point data from a path sampling simulation. Finally, the new aimless shooting version of transition path sampling retains a high sampling efficiency even for systems with highly diffusive barrier-crossing dynamics.},

The methods have been tested successfully on the Lennard-Jones system over a wide range of temperature and density, including the gas-liquid coexistence region, and are found to be extremely powerful and economical.},

	abstract = {Slab geometric boundary conditions are applied in the molecular dynamics simulation of a simple membrane-channel system. The results of the simulation were compared to those of an analogous system using normal three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. Analysis of the dynamics and electrostatics of the system show that slab geometric periodicity eliminates the artificial bulk water orientational polarization that is present while using normal three-dimensional periodicity. Furthermore, even though the water occupancy and volume of our simple channel is the same when using either method, the electrostatic properties are considerably different when using slab geometry. In particular, the orientational polarization of water is seen to be different in the interior of the channel. This gives rise to a markedly different electric field within the channel. We discuss the implications of slab geometry for the future simulation of this type of system and for the study of channel transport properties.},

In this paper we examine the crystal nucleation rate of hard spheres using three such numerical techniques: molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and a Bennett–Chandler-type theory where the nucleation barrier is determined using umbrella sampling simulations. The resulting nucleation rates are compared with the experimental rates of Harland and van Megen [Phys. Rev. E 55, 3054 (1997)], Sinn et al. [Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 118, 266 (2001)], Schätzel and Ackerson [Phys. Rev. E 48, 3766 (1993)], and the predicted rates for monodisperse and 5\% polydisperse hard spheres of Auer and Frenkel [Nature 409, 1020 (2001)]. When the rates are examined in units of the long-time diffusion coefficient, we find agreement between all the theoretically predicted nucleation rates, however, the experimental results display a markedly different behavior for low supersaturation. Additionally, we examined the precritical nuclei arising in the molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and umbrella sampling simulations. The structure of the nuclei appears independent of the simulation method, and in all cases, the nuclei contains on average significantly more face-centered-cubic ordered particles than hexagonal-close-packed ordered particles.},

	abstract = {The role of cubic ice, ice Ic, in the nucleation of ice from supercooled water has been widely debated in the past decade. Computer simulations can provide insightful information about the mechanism of ice nucleation at a molecular scale. In this work, we use molecular dynamics to study the competition between ice Ic and hexagonal ice, ice Ih, in the process of ice nucleation. Using a seeding approach, in which classical nucleation theory is combined with simulations of ice clusters embedded in supercooled water, we estimate the nucleation rate of ice for a pathway in which the critical nucleus has an Ic structure. Comparing our results with those previously obtained for ice Ih [Sanz et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 15008 (2013)], we conclude that within the accuracy of our calculations both nucleation pathways have the same rate for the studied water models (TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005). We examine in detail the factors that contribute to the nucleation rate and find that the chemical potential difference with the fluid, the attachment rate of particles to the cluster, and the ice-water interfacial free energy are the same within the estimated margin of error for both ice polymorphs. Furthermore, we study the morphology of the ice clusters and conclude that they have a spherical shape.},

The results were compared with those obtained from Becke’s exchange and Lee, Yang, and Parr’s correlation functionals (BLYP), Becke’s 3 parameter functional combined with Lee, Yang, and Parr’s correlation functional (B3LYP), second order Mo/ller–Plesset perturbation (MP2), and coupled cluster calculations with single and double substitutions and with non-iterative triple corrections [CCSD(T)] calculations. The calculated interactionenergies show that the PW91 functional performs much better than the BLYP or B3LYP functionals. The error in the computed binding energies of the hydrogen bonded complexes is 20\% in the worst case. The most demanding cases are the systems with large dispersion contributions to the binding energy, such as the benzene dimer. In contrast to the BLYP and B3LYP functionals which fail to account for dispersion, the PW91 functional at least partly recovers the attraction. The basis set dependence of the PW91 functionals is relatively small in contrast to the MP2 and CCSD(T) methods. Despite its occasional difficulties with dispersion interaction, the PW91 functional may be a viable alternative to the ab initio methods, certainly in situations where large complexes are being studied.},

Particles prepared by condensation were less active, the only newly-discovered material effective above −5C being 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene. Its use as a cloud seeding agent is suggested. Crystals of effective materials generally have molecules which display rotational symmetry. The role of molecular symmetry is discussed in connection with the formation of crystal planes with dense hydrogen bonding groups.

Whereas the effect of cholesterol on such mechanical properties has been studied exhaustively over the last decades, the structural basis for cholesterol effects on membrane permeability is still unclear. Here we apply systematic molecular dynamics simulations to study the partitioning of solutes between water and membranes. We derive potentials of mean force for six different solutes permeating across 20 different lipid membranes containing one out of four types of phospholipids plus a cholesterol content varying from 0 to 50 mol \%. Surprisingly, cholesterol decreases solute partitioning into the lipid tail region of the membranes much more strongly than expected from experiments on macroscopic membranes, suggesting that a laterally inhomogeneous cholesterol concentration and permeability may be required to explain experimental findings. The simulations indicate that the cost of breaking van der Waals interactions between the lipid tails of cholesterol-containing membranes account for the reduced partitioning rather than the surface area per phospholipid, which has been frequently suggested as a determinant for solute partitioning. The simulations further show that the partitioning is more sensitive to cholesterol (i) for larger solutes, (ii) in membranes with saturated as compared to membranes with unsaturated lipid tails, and (iii) in membranes with smaller lipid head groups.},

A series of annealed, bulk AsxS100-x glasses (x = 30 to 42) were made and their refractive indices determined at terahertz, infrared, and visible frequencies using a quasi-optical backwards wave oscillator spectrometer for terahertz measurements combined with a prism coupler for visible and infrared measurements. It was found that the refractive index at all frequencies increases with arsenic composition up to 40 at.\% arsenic and then decreases with additional arsenic. The structure in X-ray diffraction patterns supports the notion of a minimum volume at 40 at.\%, while the average covalent coordination number indicates that the rigidity percolation threshold is reached there. At arsenic concentrations \&gt;40 at.\%, the network becomes over-constrained, and the molar volume increases.},

	abstract = {Density fluctuations in liquid water are at the heart of numerous phenomena associated with hydrophobic effects such as protein folding and the interaction between biomolecules. One of the most fundamental processes in this regard is the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water. The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies examine density fluctuations at the short length scale focusing exclusively on spherical cavities. In this work, we use both first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that density fluctuations in liquid water can deviate significantly from the canonical spherical shapes. We show that regions of empty space are frequently characterized by exotic, highly asymmetric shapes that can be quite delocalized over the hydrogen bond network. Interestingly, density fluctuations of these shapes are characterized by Gaussian statistics with larger fluctuations. An important consequence of this is that the work required to create non spherical cavities can be substantially smaller than that of spheres. This feature is also qualitatively captured by the Lum–Chandler–Weeks theory. The scaling behavior of the free energy as a function of the volume at short length scales is qualitatively different for the nonspherical entities. We also demonstrate that nonspherical density fluctuations are important for accommodating the hydrophobic amino acid alanine and are thus likely to have significant implications when it comes to solvating highly asymmetrical species such as alkanes, polymers, or biomolecules.},

There is excellent evidence that surface topography is a key factor in directing crystallization in real systems; however, the mechanisms by which nanoscale pits and pores promote nucleation remain unclear. Here, we use natural cleavage defects on Muscovite mica to investigate the activity of topographical features in the nucleation from vapor of ice and various organic crystals. Direct observation of crystallization within surface pockets using optical microscopy and also interferometry demonstrates that these sharply acute features provide extremely effective nucleation sites and allows us to determine the mechanism by which this occurs. A confined phase is first seen to form along the apex of the wedge and then grows out of the pocket opening to generate a bulk crystal after a threshold saturation has been achieved. Ice nucleation proceeds in a comparable manner, although our resolution is insufficient to directly observe a condensate before the growth of a bulk crystal. These results provide insight into the mechanism of crystal deposition from vapor on real surfaces, where this will ultimately enable us to use topography to control crystal deposition on surfaces. They are also particularly relevant to our understanding of processes such as cirrus cloud formation, where such topographical features are likely candidates for the “active sites” that make clay particles effective nucleants for ice in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Colloidal gel networks are disordered elastic solids that can form even in extremely dilute particle suspensions. With interaction strengths comparable to the thermal energy, their stress-bearing network can locally restructure via breaking and reforming interparticle bonds. This allows for yielding, self-healing, and adaptive mechanics under deformation. Designing such features requires controlling stress transmission through the complex structure of the gel and this is challenging because the link between local restructuring and overall response of the network is still missing. Here, we use a space resolved analysis of dynamical processes and numerical simulations of a model gel to gain insight into this link. We show that consequences of local bond breaking propagate along the gel network over distances larger than the average mesh size. This provides the missing microscopic explanation for why nonlocal constitutive relations are necessary to rationalize the nontrivial mechanical response of colloidal gels.},

We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with a state-of-the-art empirical potential. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of “diamondlike” tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions (“graphitization”). The presented interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.},

We show how this method can be used to define collective variables and how these collective variables can be used to enhance the sampling of nucleation events. We then show how this method can be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy. The semiconducting alloy example we discuss is particular challenging as multiple nucleation centers are formed.

	abstract = {The mechanism of ice nucleation at the molecular level remains largely unknown. Nature endows antifreeze proteins (AFPs) with the unique capability of controlling ice formation. However, the effect of AFPs on ice nucleation has been under debate. Here we report the observation of both depression and promotion effects of AFPs on ice nucleation via selectively binding the ice-binding face (IBF) and the non–ice-binding face (NIBF) of AFPs to solid substrates. Freezing temperature and delay time assays show that ice nucleation is depressed with the NIBF exposed to liquid water, whereas ice nucleation is facilitated with the IBF exposed to liquid water. The generality of this Janus effect is verified by investigating three representative AFPs. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis shows that the Janus effect can be established by the distinct structures of the hydration layer around IBF and NIBF. Our work greatly enhances the understanding of the mechanism of AFPs at the molecular level and brings insights to the fundamentals of heterogeneous ice nucleation.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous nucleation of ice induced by organic materials is of fundamental importance for climate, biology, and industry. Among organic ice-nucleating surfaces, monolayers of long chain alcohols are particularly effective, while monolayers of fatty acids are significantly less so. As these monolayers expose to water hydroxyl groups with an order that resembles the one in the basal plane of ice, it was proposed that lattice matching between ice and the surface controls their ice-nucleating efficiency. Organic monolayers are soft materials and display significant fluctuations. It has been conjectured that these fluctuations assist in the nucleation of ice. Here we use molecular dynamic simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between the structure and fluctuations of hydroxylated organic surfaces and the temperature at which they nucleate ice. We find that these surfaces order interfacial water to form domains with ice-like order that are the birthplace of ice. Both mismatch and fluctuations decrease the size of the preordered domains and monotonously decrease the ice freezing temperature. The simulations indicate that fluctuations depress the freezing efficiency of monolayers of alcohols or acids to half the value predicted from lattice mismatch alone. The model captures the experimental trend in freezing efficiencies as a function of chain length and predicts that alcohols have higher freezing efficiency than acids of the same chain length. These trends are mostly controlled by the modulation of the structural mismatch to ice. We use classical nucleation theory to show that the freezing efficiencies of the monolayers are directly related to their free energy of binding to ice. This study provides a general framework to relate the equilibrium thermodynamics of ice binding to a surface and the nonequilibrium ice freezing temperature and suggests that these could be predicted from the structure of interfacial water.},

	abstract = {Cryopreservation protocols are increasingly required in regenerative medicine applications but must deliver functional products at clinical scale and comply with Good Manufacturing Process (GMP). While GMP cryopreservation is achievable on a small scale using a Stirling cryocooler-based controlled rate freezer (CRF) (EF600), successful large-scale GMP cryopreservation is more challenging due to heat transfer issues and control of ice nucleation, both complex events that impact success. We have developed a large-scale cryocooler-based CRF (VIA Freeze) that can process larger volumes and have evaluated it using alginate-encapsulated liver cell (HepG2) spheroids (ELS). It is anticipated that ELS will comprise the cellular component of a bioartificial liver and will be required in volumes of ∼2 L for clinical use. Sample temperatures and Stirling cryocooler power consumption was recorded throughout cooling runs for both small (500 μL) and large (200 mL) volume samples. ELS recoveries were assessed using viability (FDA/PI staining with image analysis), cell number (nuclei count), and function (protein secretion), along with cryoscanning electron microscopy and freeze substitution techniques to identify possible injury mechanisms. Slow cooling profiles were successfully applied to samples in both the EF600 and the VIA Freeze, and a number of cooling and warming profiles were evaluated. An optimized cooling protocol with a nonlinear cooling profile from ice nucleation to −60°C was implemented in both the EF600 and VIA Freeze. In the VIA Freeze the nucleation of ice is detected by the control software, allowing both noninvasive detection of the nucleation event for quality control purposes and the potential to modify the cooling profile following ice nucleation in an active manner. When processing 200 mL of ELS in the VIA Freeze—viabilities at 93.4\%±7.4\%, viable cell numbers at 14.3±1.7 million nuclei/mL alginate, and protein secretion at 10.5±1.7 μg/mL/24 h were obtained which, compared well with control ELS (viability −98.1\%±0.9\%; viable cell numbers −18.3±1.0 million nuclei/mL alginate; and protein secretion −18.7±1.8 μg/mL/24 h). Large volume GMP cryopreservation of ELS is possible with good functional recovery using the VIA Freeze and may also be applied to other regenerative medicine applications.},

Emission parametrizations for bacteria, fungal spores and pollen based on recent literature are introduced, as well as an immersion freezing parametrization based on classical nucleation theory and laboratory measurements. The simulated contribution of PBAPs to the global average ice nucleation rate is only 10 − 5 \%, with an uppermost estimate of 0.6\%. At the same time, observed PBAP concentrations in air and biological ice nucleus concentrations in snow are reasonably well captured by the model. This implies that 'bioprecipitation' processes (snow and rain initiated by PBAPs) are of minor importance on the global scale.},

The formation of ice in clouds is facilitated by the presence of airborne ice-nucleating particles. Sea spray is one of the major global sources of atmospheric particles, but it is unclear to what extent these particles are capable of nucleating ice. Sea-spray aerosol contains large amounts of organic material that is ejected into the atmosphere during bubble bursting at the organically enriched sea–air interface or sea surface microlayer. Here we show that organic material in the sea surface microlayer nucleates ice under conditions relevant for mixed-phase cloud and high-altitude ice cloud formation. The ice-nucleating material is probably biogenic and less than approximately 0.2 micrometres in size. We find that exudates separated from cells of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana nucleate ice, and propose that organic material associated with phytoplankton cell exudates is a likely candidate for the observed ice-nucleating ability of the microlayer samples. Global model simulations of marine organic aerosol, in combination with our measurements, suggest that marine organic material may be an important source of ice-nucleating particles in remote marine environments such as the Southern Ocean, North Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean.},

We report on onset conditions of water uptake and ice nucleation by amorphous SOA particles generated from the oxidation of naphthalene with OH radicals. Water uptake above 230 K was governed by the oxidation level of the SOA particles expressed as oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio, followed by moisture-induced phase transitions and immersion freezing. For temperatures from 200 to 230 K, SOA particles nucleated ice via deposition mode from supersaturated water vapor independent of O/C ratio at relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice) ∼10–15\% below homogeneous ice nucleation limits. The glass transition temperature (Tg) for the amorphous SOA particles was derived as a function of two parameters: (1) relative humidity (RH) with respect to water and (2) oxidation level of the SOA. The data show that particle phase and viscosity govern the particles' response to temperature and RHand provide a straightforward interpretation for the observed different heterogeneous ice nucleation pathways and water uptake by the laboratory-generated SOA and field-collected particles. Since SOA particles undergo glass transitions, these observations suggest that atmospheric SOA are potentially important for ice cloud formation and climate.},

The tested materials were carboxylated graphene nanoflakes, graphene oxide, oxidized single walled carbon nanotubes and oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The carboxylated graphene nanoflakes have a diameter of ∼30 nm and are among the smallest entities observed so far to nucleate ice. Overall, carbon nanotubes were found to nucleate ice more efficiently than flat graphene species, and less oxidized materials nucleated ice more efficiently than more oxidized species.

How does ice form on the surfaces of aerosol particles? The process is important for climate and atmospheric properties but poorly understood at the molecular level, in part because the nature of the sites where ice growth begins is unclear. Kiselev et al. used electron microscopy and computer simulations to study the deposition of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, a major component of mineral dust (see the Perspective by Murray). Surface defects of the feldspar were responsible for its high ice-nucleation efficiency.

Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.
Atmospheric ice nucleation on feldspar dust occurs at surface defects.

	abstract = {Water freezes in a wide variety of low-temperature environments, from meteors and atmospheric clouds to soil and biological cells. In nature, ice usually nucleates at or near interfaces, because homogenous nucleation in the bulk can only be observed at deep supercoolings. Although the effect of proximal surfaces on freezing has been extensively studied, major gaps in understanding remain regarding freezing near vapor–liquid interfaces, with earlier experimental studies being mostly inconclusive. The question of how a vapor–liquid interface affects freezing in its vicinity is therefore still a major open question in ice physics. Here, we address this question computationally by using the forward-flux sampling algorithm to compute the nucleation rate in a freestanding nanofilm of supercooled water. We use the TIP4P/ice force field, one of the best existing molecular models of water, and observe that the nucleation rate in the film increases by seven orders of magnitude with respect to bulk at the same temperature. By analyzing the nucleation pathway, we conclude that freezing in the film initiates not at the surface, but within an interior region where the formation of double-diamond cages (DDCs) is favored in comparison with the bulk. This, in turn, facilitates freezing by favoring the formation of nuclei rich in cubic ice, which, as demonstrated by us earlier, are more likely to grow and overcome the nucleation barrier. The films considered here are ultrathin because their interior regions are not truly bulk-like, due to their subtle structural differences with the bulk.},

	abstract = {Monolayers of aliphatic long-chain alcohols induced nucleation of ice at temperatures approaching 0°C, in contrast with water-soluble alcohols, which are effective antifreeze agents. The corresponding fatty acids, or alcohols with bulky hydrophobic groups, induce freezing at temperatures as much as 12°C lower. The freezing point induced by the amphiphilic alcohols was sensitive not only to surface area per molecule but, for the aliphatic series (CnH2n + 1OH), to chain length and parity. The freezing point for chains with n odd reached an asymptotic temperature of 0°C for an upper value of n = 31; for n even the freezing point reached a plateau of -8°C for n in the upper range of 22 to 30. The higher freezing point induced by the aliphatic alcohols is due to formation of ordered clusters in the uncompressed state as detected by grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements. The diffraction data indicate a close lattice match with the ab layer of hexagonal ice.},

In particular, the effects of solutes and mechanical pressure on the kinetics of the liquid-to-solid phase transition of supercooled water and aqueous solutions to ice have remained unresolved. Here we show from experimental data that the homogeneous nucleation of ice from supercooled aqueous solutions is independent of the nature of the solute, but depends only on the water activity of the solution—that is, the ratio between the water vapour pressures of the solution and of pure water under the same conditions. In addition, we show that the presence of solutes and the application of pressure have a very similar effect on ice nucleation. We present a thermodynamic theory for homogeneous ice nucleation, which expresses the nucleation rate coefficient as a function of water activity and pressure. Recent observations from clouds containing ice are in good agreement with our theory and our results should help to overcome one of the main weaknesses of numerical models of the atmosphere, the formulation of cloud processes.},

Here we use aircraft-aerosol time-of-flight spectrometry to directly measure the chemistry of individual cloud ice-crystal residues (obtained after evaporation of the ice), which were sampled at high altitude over Wyoming. We show that biological particles and mineral dust comprised most of the ice-crystal residues: mineral dust accounted for 50\% of the residues and biological particles for 33\%. Along with concurrent measurements of cloud ice-crystal and ice-nuclei concentrations, these observations suggest that certain biological and dust particles initiated ice formation in the sampled clouds. Finally, we use a global aerosol model to show long-range transport of desert dust, suggesting that biological particles can enhance the impact of desert dust storms on the formation of cloud ice.},

Clarifying this question is important for understanding not only the complex condensed states of H2O but also in the wider context of pressure-induced amorphization processes, which are encountered across the entire materials spectrum. We first show that ammonium fluoride (NH4F), which has a similar hydrogen-bonded network to ice I, also undergoes a pressure collapse upon compression at 77 K. However, the product material is not amorphous but NH4F II, a high-pressure phase isostructural with ice IV. This collapse can be rationalized in terms of a highly effective mechanism. In the case of ice I, the orientational disorder of the water molecules leads to a deviation from this mechanism, and we therefore classify HDA as a “derailed” state along the ice I to ice IV pathway.},

We show how this method can be used to define collective variables and how these collective variables can be used to enhance the sampling of nucleation events. We then show how this method can be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy. The semiconducting alloy example we discuss is particular challenging as multiple nucleation centers are formed.

Here, we report the results of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy experiments and density functional theory calculations which reveal a host of new structures for water–ice nanoclusters when adsorbed on an atomically flat Cu surface. The H-bonding networks within the nanoclusters resemble the resonance structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and water–ice analogues of inene, naphthalene, phenalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and triphenylene have been observed. The specific structures identified and the H-bonding patterns within them reveal new insight about water on metals that allows us to refine the so-called “2D ice rules”, which have so far proved useful in understanding water–ice structures at solid surfaces.},

We find that NaCl nucleates via the common rock salt structure. Ion desolvation—not diffusion—is identified as the limiting resistance to attachment. Two different analyses give approximately consistent attachment kinetics: diffusion along the nucleus size coordinate and reaction-diffusion analysis of approach-to-coexistence simulation data from Aragones et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2012, 136, 244508). Our simulations were performed at realistic supersaturations to enable the first direct comparison to experimental nucleation rates for this system. The computed and measured rates converge to a common upper limit at extremely high supersaturation. However, our rate predictions are between 15 and 30 orders of magnitude too fast.

The freezing of cloud droplets can be catalysed by the presence of aerosol particles known as ice nuclei. One of the most important ice nuclei is thought to be mineral dust aerosol from arid regions. It is generally assumed that clay minerals, which contribute approximately two-thirds of the dust mass, dominate ice nucleation by mineral dust, and many experimental studies have therefore focused on these materials. Here we use an established droplet-freezing technique to show that feldspar minerals dominate ice nucleation by mineral dusts under mixed-phase cloud conditions, despite feldspar being a minor component of dust emitted from arid regions. We also find that clay minerals are relatively unimportant ice nuclei. Our results from a global aerosol model study suggest that feldspar ice nuclei are globally distributed and that feldspar particles may account for a large proportion of the ice nuclei in Earth/'s atmosphere that contribute to freezing at temperatures below about -15 °C.},

Recent work suggests that feldspars are the most efficient nucleators of the minerals commonly present in atmospheric mineral dust. However, the feldspar group of minerals is complex, encompassing a range of chemical compositions and crystal structures. To further investigate the ice-nucleating properties of the feldspar group we measured the ice nucleation activities of 15 characterized feldspar samples. We show that alkali feldspars, in particular the potassium feldspars, generally nucleate ice more efficiently than feldspars in the plagioclase series which contain significant amounts of calcium. We also find that there is variability in ice nucleating ability within these groups. While five out of six potassium-rich feldspars have a similar ice nucleating ability, one potassium rich feldspar sample and one sodium-rich feldspar sample were significantly more active. The hyper-active Na-feldspar was found to lose activity with time suspended in water with a decrease in mean freezing temperature of about 16 °C over 16 months; the mean freezing temperature of the hyper-active K-feldspar decreased by 2 °C over 16 months, whereas the "standard" K-feldspar did not change activity within the uncertainty of the experiment. These results, in combination with a review of the available literature data, are consistent with the previous findings that potassium feldspars are important components of arid or fertile soil dusts for ice nucleation. However, we also show that there is the possibility that some alkali feldspars may have enhanced ice nucleating abilities, which could have implications for prediction of ice nucleating particle concentrations in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {This study is aimed at clarifying the relative importance of the specific character of the nuclei and of the duration of supercooling in heterogeneous freezing nucleation by immersed impurities. Laboratory experiments were carried out in which sets of water drops underwent multiple cycles of freezing and melting. The drops contained suspended particles of mixtures of materials; the resulting freezing temperatures ranged from −6°C to −24°C. Rank correlation coefficients between observed freezing temperatures of the drops in successive runs were {\textgreater}0.9 with very high statistical significance, and thus provide strong support for the modified singular model of heterogeneous immersion freezing nucleation. For given drops, changes in freezing temperatures between cycles were relatively small ({\textless}1°C) for the majority of the events. These frequent small fluctuations in freezing temperatures are interpreted as reflections of the random nature of embryo growth and are associated with a nucleation rate that is a function of a temperature difference from the characteristic temperatures of nuclei. About a sixth of the changes were larger, up to ±5°C, and exhibited some systematic patterns. These are thought to arise from alterations of the nuclei, some being permanent and some transitory. The results are used to suggest ways of describing ice initiation in cloud models that account for both the temperature and the time dependence of freezing nucleation.},

	abstract = {Publications of recent years dealing with laboratory experiments of immersion freezing reveal uncertainties about the fundamentals of heterogeneous freezing nucleation. While it appears well accepted that there are two major factors that determine the process, namely fluctuations in the size and configuration of incipient embryos of the solid phase and the role of the substrate to aid embryo formation, views have been evolving about the relative importance of these two elements. The importance of specific surface sites is being established in a growing number of experiments and a number of approaches have been proposed to incorporate these results into model descriptions. Many of these models share a common conceptual basis yet diverge in the way random and deterministic factors are combined. The divergence can be traced to uncertainty about the permanence of nucleating sites, to the lack of detailed knowledge about what surface features constitute nucleating sites, and to the consequent need to rely on empirical or parametric formulas to define the population of sites of different effectiveness. Recent experiments and models, consistent with earlier work, demonstrate the existence and primary role of permanent nucleating sites and the continued need for empirically based formulations of heterogeneous freezing. In order to clarify some aspects of the processes controlling immersion freezing, the paper focuses on three identifiably separate but interrelated issues: (i) the combination of singular and stochastic factors, (ii) the role of specific surface sites, and (iii) the modeling of heterogeneous ice nucleation.},

Here we present a new and computationally efficient Framework for Reconciling Observable Stochastic Time-dependence (FROST) in immersion mode ice nucleation. This framework is underpinned by the finding that the temperature dependence of the nucleation-rate coefficient controls the residence-time and cooling-rate dependence of freezing. It is shown that this framework can be used to reconcile experimental data obtained on different timescales with different experimental systems, and it also provides a simple way of representing the complexities of ice nucleation in cloud resolving models. The routine testing and reporting of time-dependent behaviour in future experimental studies is recommended, along with the practice of presenting normalised data sets following the methods outlined here.},

We then show how this method can be used to analyze simulations of crystal nucleation and growth by using it to analyze simulations of the nucleation of the molecular crystal urea and simulations of nucleation in a semiconducting alloy.

Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system.

However, the microscopic details of ice nucleation on these substances remain largely unknown. Here, we have unraveled the molecular mechanism and the kinetics of ice formation on kaolinite, a clay mineral playing a key role in climate science. We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous freezing. The critical nucleus is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface. Kaolinite also promotes the exclusive nucleation of hexagonal ice, as opposed to homogeneous freezing where a mixture of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is observed.},

The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn–Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born–Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix.

	abstract = {Heterogeneous nucleation of ice induced by organic materials is of fundamental importance for climate, biology, and industry. Among organic ice-nucleating surfaces, monolayers of long chain alcohols are particularly effective, while monolayers of fatty acids are significantly less so. As these monolayers expose to water hydroxyl groups with an order that resembles the one in the basal plane of ice, it was proposed that lattice matching between ice and the surface controls their ice-nucleating efficiency. Organic monolayers are soft materials and display significant fluctuations. It has been conjectured that these fluctuations assist in the nucleation of ice. Here we use molecular dynamic simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between the structure and fluctuations of hydroxylated organic surfaces and the temperature at which they nucleate ice. We find that these surfaces order interfacial water to form domains with ice-like order that are the birthplace of ice. Both mismatch and fluctuations decrease the size of the preordered domains and monotonously decrease the ice freezing temperature. The simulations indicate that fluctuations depress the freezing efficiency of monolayers of alcohols or acids to half the value predicted from lattice mismatch alone. The model captures the experimental trend in freezing efficiencies as a function of chain length and predicts that alcohols have higher freezing efficiency than acids of the same chain length. These trends are mostly controlled by the modulation of the structural mismatch to ice. We use classical nucleation theory to show that the freezing efficiencies of the monolayers are directly related to their free energy of binding to ice. This study provides a general framework to relate the equilibrium thermodynamics of ice binding to a surface and the nonequilibrium ice freezing temperature and suggests that these could be predicted from the structure of interfacial water.},

Phys. 136, 244508 (2012)] has been used, except, that all calculations for the NaCl in solution were obtained by using molecular dynamics simulations with the GROMACS package instead of homemade MC programs. We have explored new lower molalities and made longer runs to improve the accuracy of the calculations. Exploring the low molality region allowed us to obtain an analytical expression for the chemical potential of the ions in solution as a function of molality valid for a wider range of molalities, including the infinite dilute case. These new results are in better agreement with recent estimations of the solubility obtained with other methodologies. Besides, two empirical simple rules have been obtained to have a rough estimate of the solubility of a certain model, by analyzing the ionic pairs formation as a function of molality and/or by calculating the difference between the NaCl solid chemical potential and the standard chemical potential of the salt in solution.},

	abstract = {, We study the influence of different
surfactants on NaCl crystallization
during evaporation of aqueous salt solutions. We found that at concentrations
of sodium chloride close to saturation, only the cationic surfactant
CTAB and the nonionic surfactant Tween 80 remain stable. For the nonionic
surfactant, the high concentration of salt does not significantly
change either the critical micellar concentration (CMC) or the surface
tension at the CMC; for the cationic surfactant, the CMC is reduced
by roughly 2 orders of magnitude upon adding the salt. The presence
of both types of surfactants in the salt solution delays the crystallization
of sodium chloride with evaporation. This, in turn, leads to high
supersaturation which induces the rapid precipitation of a hopper
crystal in the bulk. The crystallization inhibitor role of these surfactants
is shown to be mainly due to the passivation of nucleation sites at
both liquid/air and solid/liquid interfaces rather than a change in
the evaporation rate which is found not to be affected by the presence
of the surfactants. The adsorption of surfactants at the liquid/air
interface prevents the crystallization at this location which is generally
the place where the precipitation of sodium chloride is observed.
Moreover, sum frequency generation spectroscopy measurements show
that the surfactants are also present at the solid/liquid interface.
The incorporation of the surfactants into the salt crystals is investigated
using a novel, but simple, method based on surface tension measurements.
Our results show that the nonionic surfactant Tween 80 is incorporated
in the NaCl crystals but the cationic surfactant CTAB is not. Taken
together, these results therefore allow us to establish the effect
of the presence of surfactants on sodium chloride crystallization.},

Brickwork-like patterns typical for terephthalic acid self-assembly have been observed for all three molecules. However, several differences became apparent: (i) formation or lack of adsorbed monolayers (self-assembled monolayers formed in all systems, with one notable exception of terephthalic acid at the graphite/1-phenyloctane interface where no adsorption was observed), (ii) the size of adsorbate islands (large islands at the interface with heptanoic acid and smaller ones at the interface with 1-phenyloctane), (iii) polymorphism of the hydroxylated terephthalic acid monolayers, dependent on the molecular structure and/or solvent. To rationalise this behaviour, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations have been performed, to analyse the three key aspects of the energetics of self-assembly: intermolecular, substrate-adsorbate and solvent-solute interactions. These energetic characteristics of self-assembly were brought together in a Born-Haber cycle, to obtain the overall energy effects of formation of self-assembled monolayers at these liquid/solid interfaces.},

	abstract = {In little more than 20 years, the number of applications of the density functional (DF) formalism in chemistry and materials science has grown in an astonishing fashion. The number of publications alone shows that DF calculations make up a huge success story, and many younger colleagues are surprised to learn that the widespread application of density functional methods, particularly in chemistry, began only after 1990. This is indeed unexpected, because the origins are usually traced to the papers of Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham more than a quarter of a century earlier. The DF formalism, its applications, and prospects were reviewed for this journal in 1989. About the same time, the combination of DF calculations with molecular dynamics promised to provide an efficient way to study structures and reactions in molecules and extended systems. This paper reviews the development of density-related methods back to the early years of quantum mechanics and follows the breakthrough in their application after 1990. The two examples from biochemistry and materials science are among the many current applications that were simply far beyond expectations in 1990. The reasons why—50 years after its modern formulation and after two decades of rapid expansion—some of the most cited practitioners in the field are concerned about its future are discussed.},

	abstract = {We review here for the first time, the literature on control of ice nucleation in cryopreservation. Water and aqueous solutions have a tendency to undercool before ice nucleation occurs. Control of ice nucleation has been recognised as a critical step in the cryopreservation of embryos and oocytes but is largely ignored for other cell types. We review the processes of ice nucleation and crystal growth in the solution around cells and tissues during cryopreservation with an emphasis on non IVF applications. The extent of undercooling that is encountered during the cooling of various cryocontainers is defined and the methods that have been employed to control the nucleation of ice are examined. The effects of controlled ice nucleation on the structure of the sample and the outcome of cryopreservation of a range of cell types and tissues are presented and the physical events which define the cellular response are discussed. Nucleation of ice is the most significant uncontrolled variable in conventional cryopreservation leading to sample to sample variation in cell recovery, viability and function and should be controlled to allow standardisation of cryopreservation protocols for cells for biobanking, cell based assays or clinical application. This intervention allows a way of increasing viability of cells and reducing variability between samples and should be included as standard operating procedures are developed.},

The influence of the electric field on the freezing temperature of supercooled water (electrofreezing) is of topical importance in the living and inanimate worlds. We report that positively charged surfaces of pyroelectric LiTaO3 crystals and SrTiO3 thin films promote ice nucleation, whereas the same surfaces when negatively charged reduce the freezing temperature. Accordingly, droplets of water cooled down on a negatively charged LiTaO3 surface and remaining liquid at –11°C freeze immediately when this surface is heated to –8°C, as a result of the replacement of the negative surface charge by a positive one. Furthermore, powder x-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that the freezing on the positively charged surface starts at the solid/water interface, whereas on a negatively charged surface, ice nucleation starts at the air/water interface.
Supercooled water on a surface can freeze upon heating in response to surface charge switching from negative to positive.

	abstract = {Nucleation is a fundamental step in crystal growth. Of environmental and materials relevance are reactions that lead to nucleation of iron oxyhydroxides in aqueous solutions. These reactions are difficult to study experimentally due to their rapid kinetics. Here, we used classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate nucleation of iron hydroxide/oxyhydroxide nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. Results show that in a solution containing ferric ions and hydroxyl groups, iron–hydroxyl molecular clusters form by merging ferric monomers, dimers, and other oligomers, driven by strong affinity of ferric ions to hydroxyls. When deprotonation reactions are not considered in the simulations, these clusters aggregate to form small iron hydroxide nanocrystals with a six-membered ring-like layered structure allomeric to gibbsite. By comparison, in a solution containing iron chloride and sodium hydroxide, the presence of chlorine drives cluster assembly along a different direction to form long molecular chains (rather than rings) composed of Fe–O octahedra linked by edge sharing. Further, in chlorine-free solutions, when deprotonation reactions are considered, the simulations predict ultimate formation of amorphous iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles with local atomic structure similar to that of ferrihydrite nanoparticles. Overall, our simulation results reveal that nucleation of iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles proceeds via a cluster aggregation-based nonclassical pathway.},

However, nucleation pathways are still not fully understood, whereby the case of iron (oxyhydr)oxides poses a prime example. We show that in the prenucleation regime, thermodynamically stable solute species up to a few nanometers in size are observed, which meet the definition of prenucleation clusters. Nucleation then is not governed by a critical size, but rather by the dynamics of the clusters that are forming at the distinct nucleation stages, based on the chemistry of the linkages within the clusters. This resolves a longstanding debate in the field of iron oxide nucleation, and the results may generally apply to oxides forming via hydrolysis and condensation. The (molecular) understanding of the chemical basis of phase separation is paramount for, e.g., tailoring size, shape and structure of novel nanocrystalline materials.},

For numerous systems, the formation of the thermodynamically stable crystalline phase is additionally preceded by metastable intermediates . More complex pathways have recently been proposed, such as aggregational processes of nanoparticle precursors or pre-nucleation clusters, which seem to contradict the classical theory. Here we show by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy that the nucleation and growth of magnetite—a magnetic iron oxide with numerous bio- and nanotechnological applications—proceed through rapid agglomeration of nanometric primary particles and that in contrast to the nucleation of other minerals, no intermediate amorphous bulk precursor phase is involved. We also demonstrate that these observations can be described within the framework of classical nucleation theory.},

However, the peculiar features that make these materials so attractive for memory devices still lack a comprehensive microscopic understanding. By means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the supercooled liquid of the prototypical compound GeTe shows a very high atomic mobility (D ∼10−6 cm2 s−1) down to temperatures close to the glass transition temperatures. This behavior leads to a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation between the self-diffusion coefficient and the viscosity in the supercooled liquid. The results suggest that the fragility of the supercooled liquid is the key to understand the fast crystallization process in this class of materials.},

Recent work has also established that excitations in atomistic models have statistics and dynamics like those in a specific class of kinetically constrained models. But it has not been known whether the non-equilibrium phase transitions occurring in the two classes of models have similar origins. Here, we show that the origin is indeed similar. In particular, we show that the number of excitations identified in an atomistic model serves as the order parameter for the inactive–active phase transition for that model. In this way, we show that the mechanism by which excitations are correlated in an atomistic model – by dynamical facilitation – is the mechanism from which the active–inactive phase transition emerges. We study properties of the inactive phase and show that it is amorphous lacking long-range order. We also discuss the choice of dynamical order parameters.},

Application of large-deviation theory allows us to prepare such phases in computer simulations. Along with nonequilibrium transitions between the ergodic liquid and two distinct amorphous solids, we establish coexistence between these two amorphous solids. The phase diagram we predict includes a nonequilibrium triple point where two amorphous phases and the liquid coexist. Whereas the amorphous solids are long-lived and slowly aging glasses, their melting can lead quickly to the formation of crystalline ice. Further, melting of the higher density amorphous solid at low pressures takes place in steps, transitioning to the lower-density glass before accessing a nonequilibrium liquid from which ice coarsens.},

	abstract = {Glasses are amorphous solids, in the sense that they display elastic behaviour. In crystalline solids, elasticity is associated with phonons, which are quantized vibrational excitations. Phonon-like excitations also exist in glasses at very high (terahertz; 1012 Hz) frequencies; surprisingly, these persist in the supercooled liquids. A universal feature of such amorphous systems is the boson peak: the vibrational density of states has an excess compared to the Debye squared-frequency law. Here we investigate the origin of this feature by studying the spectra of inherent structures (local minima of the potential energy) in a realistic glass model. We claim that the peak is the signature of a phase transition in the space of the stationary points of the energy, from a minima-dominated phase (with phonons) at low energy to a saddle-point-dominated phase (without phonons). The boson peak moves to lower frequencies on approaching the phonon–saddle transition, and its height diverges at the critical point. Our numerical results agree with the predictions of euclidean random matrix theory on the existence of a sharp phase transition between an amorphous elastic phase and a phonon-free one.},

Although water is the most abundant compound on earth, it is definitely not a simple liquid. It possesses strongly polar hydrogen bonds which are responsible for a striking set of anomalous physical and chemical properties. For more than a century the combined importance and peculiarity of water inspired scientists to construct conceptual models, which in themselves reproduce the observed behavior of the liquid. The exploration of structural and binding properties of small water complexes provides a key for understanding bulk water in its liquid and solid phase and for understanding solvation phenomena. Modern ab initio quantum chemistry methods and high-resolution spectroscopy methods have been extremely successful in describing such structures. Cluster models for liquid water try to mimic the transition from these clusters to bulk water. The important question is: What cluster properties are required to describe liquid-phase behavior?},

In particular, the ability to measure X-ray and neutron diffraction of water with unprecedented high accuracy in an extended range of momentum transfers has allowed the derivation of detailed O–O pair correlation functions. A panorama of the diffusive dynamics of water in a wide range of temperatures (from 400 K down to supercooled water) and pressures (from ambient up to multiple gigapascals) is presented. The recent results obtained by quasi-elastic neutron scattering under high pressure are compared with the existing data from nuclear magnetic resonance, dielectric and infrared measurements, and modeling. A detailed description of the vibrational dynamics of water as measured by inelastic neutron scattering is presented. The dependence of the water vibrational density of states on temperature and pressure, and in the presence of biological molecules, is discussed. Results about the collective dynamics of water and its dispersion curves as measured by coherent inelastic neutron scattering and inelastic X-ray scattering in different thermodynamic conditions are reported.},

Unlike charge-based electronics that are prone to leakage at nanoscale dimensions, memory devices based on phase change materials (PCMs) are more scalable, storing digital information as the crystalline or amorphous state of a material. Here, we describe a novel approach to self-align PCM nanowires with individual carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes for the first time. The highly scaled and spatially confined memory devices approach the ultimate scaling limits of PCM technology, achieving ultralow programming currents (∼0.1 μA set, ∼1.6 μA reset), outstanding on/off ratios (∼103), and improved endurance and stability at few-nanometer bit dimensions. In addition, the powerful yet simple nanofabrication approach described here can enable confining and probing many other nanoscale and molecular devices self-aligned with CNT electrodes.},

External functionalization with tBu groups led to enhanced solubility of the cages in aqueous methanol solutions, thereby allowing for their thorough characterization by multinuclear (1H, 13C, 77Se) and diffusion NMR spectroscopies. Additional experimental characterization by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, UV–vis spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations, led to a detailed understanding of the cage structures, self-assembly, and anion encapsulation. We found that the cage self-assembly is templated by EO4n– oxoanions (n ≥ 2), and upon removal of the templating anion the tetrahedral M4L6 cages rearrange into different coordination assemblies. The exchange selectivity among EO4n– oxoanions has been investigated with 77Se NMR spectroscopy using 77SeO42– as an anionic probe, which found the following selectivity trend: PO43– ≫ CrO42– {\textgreater} SO42– {\textgreater} SeO42– {\textgreater} MoO42– {\textgreater} WO42–. In addition to the complementarity and flexibility of the cage receptor, a combination of factors have been found to contribute to the observed anion selectivity, including the anions’ charge, size, hydration, basicity, and hydrogen-bond acceptor abilities.},

	abstract = {While the existence of nanoscale dynamical heterogeneity in biological membranes has been suggested to act as an active functional platform for enabling various cellular processes like signal transduction and viral or bacterial entry, it has been extremely difficult to detect the existence of such domains. Model lipid bilayer membranes have been widely used to detect such dynamical heterogeneity in order to avoid complications arising from the compositional heterogeneity of cellular membranes. However, even in model biological membranes the issue of nanoscale lipid dynamics has remained controversial and unresolved due to the difficulty of detecting the existence of such dynamical heterogeneity on the scale of 10–300 nm. Here we report direct evidence of nanoscale lipid dynamical heterogeneity in model binary lipid bilayer membranes using a combination of super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We control the phase behavior of the lipid bilayers by varying their composition and discuss how this leads to the emergence of dynamical lipid domains on the scale of 80–150 nm, which is also dependent on the lipid phase in which such dynamics are observed. Notably, our work shows that the presence of cholesterol is not required for the existence of such domains even in fluid like bilayers, as has been widely believed, and specifies the minimal conditions required for the emergence of such dynamical heterogeneity in cellular membranes. Our work will thus not only be of great significance towards understanding the nanoscale dynamic organizing principles of cellular membranes but could also be useful in understanding the dynamics of related soft matter systems and nanoparticle–cell membrane interactions.},

These substructures, identified in a 10 μs all-atom trajectory of liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered coexistence (Lo/Ld) are composed of saturated hydrocarbon chains packed with local hexagonal order and separated by interstitial regions enriched in cholesterol and unsaturated chains. Lipid hydrocarbon chain order parameters calculated from the Lo phase are in excellent agreement with 2H NMR measurements; the local hexagonal packing is also consistent with 1H-MAS NMR spectra of the Lo phase, NMR diffusion experiments, and small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering. The balance of cholesterol-rich to local hexagonal order is proposed to control the partitioning of membrane components into the Lo regions. The latter have been frequently associated with formation of so-called rafts, platforms in the plasma membranes of cells that facilitate interaction between components of signaling pathways.},

While in methanol and ethanol a single-step nucleation process is favored, in acetonitrile a two-step process emerges as the most likely nucleation pathway.

Control of ice nucleation has been recognised as a critical step in the cryopreservation of embryos and oocytes but is largely ignored for other cell types. We review the processes of ice nucleation and crystal growth in the solution around cells and tissues during cryopreservation with an emphasis on non IVF applications. The extent of undercooling that is encountered during the cooling of various cryocontainers is defined and the methods that have been employed to control the nucleation of ice are examined. The effects of controlled ice nucleation on the structure of the sample and the outcome of cryopreservation of a range of cell types and tissues are presented and the physical events which define the cellular response are discussed. Nucleation of ice is the most significant uncontrolled variable in conventional cryopreservation leading to sample to sample variation in cell recovery, viability and function and should be controlled to allow standardisation of cryopreservation protocols for cells for biobanking, cell based assays or clinical application. This intervention allows a way of increasing viability of cells and reducing variability between samples and should be included as standard operating procedures are developed.},

With their ability to induce ice formation at temperatures just below the ice melting point, bacteria such as Pseudomonas syringae attack plants through frost damage using specialized ice-nucleating proteins. Besides the impact on agriculture and microbial ecology, airborne P. syringae can affect atmospheric glaciation processes, with consequences for cloud evolution, precipitation, and climate. Biogenic ice nucleation is also relevant for artificial snow production and for biomimetic materials for controlled interfacial freezing. We use interface-specific sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to show that hydrogen bonding at the water-bacteria contact imposes structural ordering on the adjacent water network. Experimental SFG data and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that ice-active sites within P. syringae feature unique hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterns to enhance ice nucleation. The freezing transition is further facilitated by the highly effective removal of latent heat from the nucleation site, as apparent from time-resolved SFG spectroscopy.
Specialized bacteria trigger ice formation by controlling the molecular structure and energy transfer in interfacial water.

How much global average temperature eventually will rise depends on the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), which relates atmospheric CO2 concentration to atmospheric temperature. For decades, ECS has been estimated to be between 2.0° and 4.6°C, with much of that uncertainty owing to the difficulty of establishing the effects of clouds on Earth's energy budget. Tan et al. used satellite observations to constrain the radiative impact of mixed phase clouds. They conclude that ECS could be between 5.0° and 5.3°C—higher than suggested by most global climate models.
Science, this issue p. 224
Global climate model (GCM) estimates of the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2, measured by the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), range from 2.0° to 4.6°C. Clouds are among the leading causes of this uncertainty. Here we show that the ECS can be up to 1.3°C higher in simulations where mixed-phase clouds consisting of ice crystals and supercooled liquid droplets are constrained by global satellite observations. The higher ECS estimates are directly linked to a weakened cloud-phase feedback arising from a decreased cloud glaciation rate in a warmer climate. We point out the need for realistic representations of the supercooled liquid fraction in mixed-phase clouds in GCMs, given the sensitivity of the ECS to the cloud-phase feedback.
Weaknesses in cloud parameterizations may be causing global climate models to underestimate future warming.

The freezing of cloud droplets can be catalysed by the presence of aerosol particles known as ice nuclei. One of the most important ice nuclei is thought to be mineral dust aerosol from arid regions. It is generally assumed that clay minerals, which contribute approximately two-thirds of the dust mass, dominate ice nucleation by mineral dust, and many experimental studies have therefore focused on these materials. Here we use an established droplet-freezing technique to show that feldspar minerals dominate ice nucleation by mineral dusts under mixed-phase cloud conditions, despite feldspar being a minor component of dust emitted from arid regions. We also find that clay minerals are relatively unimportant ice nuclei. Our results from a global aerosol model study suggest that feldspar ice nuclei are globally distributed and that feldspar particles may account for a large proportion of the ice nuclei in Earth/'s atmosphere that contribute to freezing at temperatures below about -15 °C.},

Theoretical and experimental studies over the last 60 years provide a complex picture of silver iodide as an ice-nucleating agent with conflicting and inconsistent results. This review compares experimental ice nucleation studies in order to analyze the factors that influence the ice nucleation ability of AgI. The following picture emerges from this analysis: the ice nucleation ability of AgI seems to be enhanced when the AgI particle is on the surface of a droplet, which is indeed the position that a particle takes when it can freely move in a droplet. The ice nucleation by particles with surfaces exposed to air depends on water adsorption. AgI surfaces seem to be most efficient at nucleating ice when they are exposed to relative humidity at or even above water saturation. For AgI particles that are completely immersed in water, the freezing temperature increases with increasing AgI surface area. Higher threshold freezing temperatures seem to correlate with improved lattice matches as can be seen for AgI–AgCl solid solutions and 3AgI·NH4I·6H2O, which have slightly better lattice matches with ice than AgI and also higher threshold freezing temperatures. However, the effect of a good lattice match is annihilated when the surfaces have charges. Also, the ice nucleation ability seems to decrease during dissolution of AgI particles. This introduces an additional history and time dependence for ice nucleation in cloud chambers with short residence times.},

As the most efficient nuclei (silver birch, Scots pine and common juniper pollen) have a distribution area up to the Northern timberline, their ice nucleation activity might be a cryoprotective mechanism. Far more intriguingly, it has turned out that water, which has been in contact with pollen and then been separated from the bodies, nucleates as good as the pollen grains themselves. The ice nuclei have to be easily-suspendable macromolecules located on the pollen. Once extracted, they can be distributed further through the atmosphere than the heavy pollen grains and so presumably augment the impact of pollen on ice cloud formation even in the upper troposphere. Our experiments lead to the conclusion that pollen ice nuclei, in contrast to bacterial and fungal ice nucleating proteins, are non-proteinaceous compounds.},

They are already used in rewriteable optical data storage and offer great potential as an emerging non-volatile electronic memory. This review looks at the unique property combination that characterizes phase-change materials. The crystalline state often shows an octahedral-like atomic arrangement, frequently accompanied by pronounced lattice distortions and huge vacancy concentrations. This can be attributed to the chemical bonding in phase-change alloys, which is promoted by p-orbitals. From this insight, phase-change alloys with desired properties can be designed. This is demonstrated for the optical properties of phase-change alloys, in particular the contrast between the amorphous and crystalline states. The origin of the fast crystallization kinetics is also discussed.},

The calculations allowed us to estimate the electron-phonon contribution to the thermal boundary resistance at the interface between the crystalline and amorphous phases present in the device. The lattice contribution to the thermal boundary resistance has been computed by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with an interatomic potential based on a neural network scheme. We find that the electron-phonon term contributes to the thermal boundary resistance to an extent which is strongly dependent on the concentration and mobility of the holes. Further, for measured values of the holes concentration and electrical conductivity, the electron-phonon term is larger than the contribution from the lattice. It is also shown that the presence of Ge vacancies, responsible for the p-type degenerate character of the semiconductor, strongly affects the lattice thermal conductivity of the crystal.},

It is commonplace to truncate these potentials for computational efficiency based on the assumption that errors are negligible for reasonable cutoffs or compensated for by adjusting other interaction parameters. Arising from a metadynamics study of the wetting transition of water on a solid substrate, we find that the influence of the cutoff is unexpectedly strong and can change the character of the wetting transition from continuous to first order by creating artificial metastable wetting states. Common cutoff corrections such as the use of a force switching function, a shifted potential, or a shifted force do not avoid this. Such a qualitative difference urges caution and suggests that using truncated non-bonded potentials can induce unphysical behavior that cannot be fully accounted for by adjusting other interaction parameters.},

This chapter presents the results of NN simulations on the properties of liquid and amorphous GeTe including thermal conductivity and the homogeneous and heterogeneous crystallization of the amorphous. Phase change materials (PCM), recently used extensively in non-volatile rewritable memory devices, undergo a stable, rapid and reversible transition between a crystalline and an amorphous atomic structure. The coefficients for the Arrhenius function were derived by fitting the simulation results to the experimental data for the crystallization velocity. PCM, and especially Ge-Sb-Te (GST) alloys are leading candidates for such an innovative generation of non-volatile memory.

An amorphous calcium sulfate (ACS) phase can also precede precipitation of hemihydrate. Here, we profit from these observations to generate ACS and hemihydrate particles that have considerable stability in solution. By precipitating calcium sulfate in the presence of poly(acrylic acid), poly(styrene-4-sulfonate), sodium triphosphate and magnesium ions, we show that it is possible to use these additives to retard the transformation of these metastable mineral phases, and thereby readily isolate hemihydrate. These additives are also active in controlling the morphologies of the hemihydrate crystals, which can play a key role in defining properties such as porosity and mechanical strength. The results confirm the stepwise-precipitation of gypsum via amorphous and hemihydrate intermediates and suggest an alternative to the energy-intensive calcination processes which are currently widely used to prepare hemihydrate.},

In complementary approaches experiment, analytic theory and simulation have been employed to study colloidal solidification in great detail. These studies were based on advanced optical methods, careful system characterization and sophisticated numerical methods. Over the last decade, both the effects of the type, strength and range of the pair-interaction between the colloidal particles and those of the colloid-specific polydispersity have been addressed in a quantitative way. Key parameters of crystallization have been derived and compared to those of metal systems. These systematic investigations significantly contributed to an enhanced understanding of the crystallization processes in general. Further, new fundamental questions have arisen and (partially) been solved over the last decade: including, for example, a two-step nucleation mechanism in homogeneous nucleation, choice of the crystallization pathway, or the subtle interplay of boundary conditions in heterogeneous nucleation. On the other hand, via the application of both gradients and external fields the competition between different nucleation and growth modes can be controlled and the resulting microstructure be influenced. The present review attempts to cover the interesting developments that have occurred since the turn of the millennium and to identify important novel trends, with particular focus on experimental aspects.},

	abstract = {The nucleation of crystals in liquids is one of nature’s most ubiquitous phenomena, playing an important role in areas such as climate change and the production of drugs. As the early stages of nucleation involve exceedingly small time and length scales, atomistic computer simulations can provide unique insights into the microscopic aspects of crystallization. In this review, we take stock of the numerous molecular dynamics simulations that, in the past few decades, have unraveled crucial aspects of crystal nucleation in liquids. We put into context the theoretical framework of classical nucleation theory and the state-of-the-art computational methods by reviewing simulations of such processes as ice nucleation and the crystallization of molecules in solutions. We shall see that molecular dynamics simulations have provided key insights into diverse nucleation scenarios, ranging from colloidal particles to natural gas hydrates, and that, as a result, the general applicability of classical nucleation theory has been repeatedly called into question. We have attempted to identify the most pressing open questions in the field. We believe that, by improving (i) existing interatomic potentials and (ii) currently available enhanced sampling methods, the community can move toward accurate investigations of realistic systems of practical interest, thus bringing simulations a step closer to experiments.},

	abstract = {Biological electron-transfer (ET) reactions are typically described in the framework of coherent two-state electron tunneling or multistep hopping. However, these ET reactions may involve multiple redox cofactors in van der Waals contact with each other and with vibronic broadenings on the same scale as the energy gaps among the species. In this regime, fluctuations of the molecular structures and of the medium can produce transient energy level matching among multiple electronic states. This transient degeneracy, or flickering electronic resonance among states, is found to support coherent (ballistic) charge transfer. Importantly, ET rates arising from a flickering resonance (FR) mechanism will decay exponentially with distance because the probability of energy matching multiple states is multiplicative. The distance dependence of FR transport thus mimics the exponential decay that is usually associated with electron tunneling, although FR transport involves real carrier population on the bridge and is not a tunneling phenomenon. Likely candidates for FR transport are macromolecules with ET groups in van der Waals contact: DNA, bacterial nanowires, multiheme proteins, strongly coupled porphyrin arrays, and proteins with closely packed redox-active residues. The theory developed here is used to analyze DNA charge-transfer kinetics, and we find that charge-transfer distances up to three to four bases may be accounted for with this mechanism. Thus, the observed rapid (exponential) distance dependence of DNA ET rates over distances of ≲15 Å does not necessarily prove a tunneling mechanism.},

We have taken advantage of the detailed analysis carried out in the first paper to implement robust fitting techniques. In addition, new models to introduce temperature effects have been incorporated, from the simple Debye model contained in the original article to a full quasiharmonic model that requires the phonon density of states at each calculated volume. Other interesting novel features include the empirical energy corrections, that rectify systematic errors in the calculation of equilibrium volumes caused by the choice of the exchange-correlation functional, the electronic contributions to the free energy and the automatic computation of phase diagrams.

Despite its importance, we lack a fundamental understanding of what makes substrates efficient ice nucleators. Here we address this by computing the ice nucleation (IN) ability of numerous model hydroxylated substrates with diverse surface hydroxyl (OH) group arrangements. Overall, for the substrates considered, we find that neither the symmetry of the OH patterns nor the similarity between a substrate and ice correlate well with the IN ability. Instead, we find that the OH density and the substrate-water interaction strength are useful descriptors of a material's IN ability. This insight allows the rationalization of ice nucleation ability across a wide range of materials and can aid the search and design of novel potent ice nucleators in the future.},

How does ice form on the surfaces of aerosol particles? The process is important for climate and atmospheric properties but poorly understood at the molecular level, in part because the nature of the sites where ice growth begins is unclear. Kiselev et al. used electron microscopy and computer simulations to study the deposition of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, a major component of mineral dust (see the Perspective by Murray). Surface defects of the feldspar were responsible for its high ice-nucleation efficiency.

Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.
Atmospheric ice nucleation on feldspar dust occurs at surface defects.

However, the microscopic details of ice nucleation on these substances remain largely unknown. Here, we have unraveled the molecular mechanism and the kinetics of ice formation on kaolinite, a clay mineral playing a key role in climate science. We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous freezing. The critical nucleus is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface. Kaolinite also promotes the exclusive nucleation of hexagonal ice, as opposed to homogeneous freezing where a mixture of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is observed.},

Crystallization is also central to understand natural processes that include the formation of atmospheric ice and biomineralization. Organic surfaces, biomolecules, and even liquid/vapor interfaces can promote the nucleation of crystals. These soft surfaces present significant structural fluctuations, which have been shown to strongly impact the rate of crystallization. This raises the question of whether degrees of freedom of soft surfaces play a role in the reaction coordinate for crystal nucleation. Here we use molecular simulations to investigate the mechanism of ice nucleation promoted by an alcohol monolayer. Our analysis indicates that while the flexibility of the surface strongly depresses its ice nucleation ability, it does not play a role in the coordinate that controls the transformation from liquid to ice. We find that the variable that drives the transformation is the size of the crystalline cluster, the same as that for the homogeneous crystallization. We argue that this is a general result that arises from the separation of time scales between surface fluctuations and the crossing of the transition state barrier for crystallization.},

	abstract = {In the present review, we describe current knowledge about synthesis of borate crosslinked rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) and it physiological roles. RG-II is a portion of pectic polysaccharide with high complexity, present in primary cell wall. It is composed of homogalacturonan backbone and four distinct side chains (A-D). Borate forms ester bonds with the apiosyl residues of side chain A of two RG-II monomers to generate borate dimerized RG-II, contributing for the formation of networks of pectic polysaccharides. In plant cell walls, more than 90\% of RG-II are dimerized by borate under B sufficient conditions. Borate crosslinking of RG-II in primary cell walls, to our knowledge, is the only experimentally proven molecular function of boron (B), an essential trace-element. Although abundance of RG-II and B is quite small in cell wall polysaccharides, increasing evidence supports that RG-II and its borate crosslinking are critical for plant growth and development. Significant advancement was made recently on the location and the mechanisms of RG-II synthesis and borate cross-linking. Molecular genetic studies have successfully identified key enzymes for RG-II synthesis and regulators including B transporters required for efficient formation of RG-II crosslinking and consequent normal plant growth. The present article focuses recent advances on (i) RG-II polysaccharide synthesis, (ii) occurrence of borate crosslinking and (iii) B transport for borate supply to RG-II. Molecular mechanisms underlying formation of borate RG-II crosslinking and the physiological impacts are discussed.},

	abstract = {Walls of growing plants are extremely complex and sophisticated composite materials incorporating a dynamic assembly of polysaccharides, proteins and phenolics. Among the polysaccharides, the pectins encompass a group of acidic heteropolysaccharides; they offer a repertoire of structural complexity associated with the occurrence of, at least, three specific domains. Whereas most of these domains are notable for their structural heterogeneity, one of these, the so-called rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) exhibits a remarkable conservation throughout the plant kingdom. RG-II is thought to be the most complex plant polysaccharide on Earth (MW 5–10 kDa); its occurrence and strong conservation may indicate that it plays a major role in the structure and growth of higher plants. The present paper examines the most recent findings related to the occurrence, the structures, biosynthesis, biological role and properties, functional properties and technological applications of RG-II. Particular emphasis is given on the description of the three-dimensional structures of RG-II, in its monomeric and dimeric form as elucidated from the concerted investigations throughout 800 MHz NMR spectroscopy, light scattering, atomic force microscopy along with molecular mechanics and dynamics. Some attempts of deciphering of the structural role that RG-II may play in the cell wall of growing plants are presented.},

	abstract = {Controlling thermal transport in solids is of paramount importance for many applications. Often thermal management is crucial for a device's performance, as it affects both reliability and power consumption. A number of intricate concepts have been developed to address this challenge, such as diamond-like coatings to enhance the thermal conductivity or low symmetry complex super-structures to reduce it. Here, a different approach is pursued, where we explore the potential of solids with a high yet controllable degree of disorder. Recently, it has been demonstrated that an unconventionally high degree of structural disorder characterizes a number of crystalline phase-change materials (PCMs). This disorder strongly impacts electronic transport and even leads to disorder induced localization (Anderson localization). This raises the question how thermal transport is affected by such conditions. Here thermal transport in highly disordered crystalline Ge–Sb–Te (GST) based PCMs is investigated. Glass-like thermal properties are observed for several crystalline PCMs, which are attributed to strong scattering by disordered point defects. A systematic study of different compounds along the pseudo-binary line between GeTe and Sb 2 Te 3 reveals that disordered vacancies act as point defects responsible for pronounced phonon scattering. Annealing causes a gradual ordering of the vacancies and leads to a more ‘crystal-like’ thermal conductivity. While both vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom are affected by disorder, the consequences differ for different stoichiometries. This opens up a pathway to tune electrical and thermal transport by controlling the degree of disorder. Materials with tailored transport properties may not only help to improve power efficiency and scaling in upcoming phase-change memories but are also of fundamental interest in the field of thermoelectric materials.},

The resulting corrected DFT scheme is considerably more accurate than uncorrected DFT for the relative energies of small water clusters and different ice structures and significantly improves the description of the structure and dynamics of liquid water. However, our results for ice structures and the liquid indicate that beyond-two-body DFT errors cannot be ignored, and we suggest how our machine-learning methods can be further developed to correct these errors.},

We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with a state-of-the-art empirical potential. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of “diamondlike” tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions (“graphitization”). The presented interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.},

Remarkably, our model draws structural information from liquid and amorphous carbon exclusively, and so does not have any prior knowledge of crystalline phases: it therefore demonstrates true transferability, which is a crucial prerequisite for applications in chemistry.

	abstract = {Amorphous Si (a-Si) nanostructures are ubiquitous in numerous electronic and optoelectronic devices. Amorphous materials are considered to possess the lower limit to the thermal conductivity (κ), which is ∼1 W·m–1 K–1 for a-Si. However, recent work suggested that κ of micrometer-thick a-Si films can be greater than 3 W·m–1 K–1, which is contributed to by propagating vibrational modes, referred to as “propagons”. However, precise determination of κ in a-Si has been elusive. Here, we used structures of a-Si nanotubes and suspended a-Si films that enabled precise in-plane thermal conductivity (κ∥) measurement within a wide thickness range of 5 nm to 1.7 μm. We showed unexpectedly high κ∥ in a-Si nanostructures, reaching ∼3.0 and 5.3 W·m–1 K–1 at ∼100 nm and 1.7 μm, respectively. Furthermore, the measured κ∥ is significantly higher than the cross-plane κ on the same films. This unusually high and anisotropic thermal conductivity in the amorphous Si nanostructure manifests the surprisingly broad propagon mean free path distribution, which is found to range from 10 nm to 10 μm, in the disordered and atomically isotropic structure. This result provides an unambiguous answer to the century-old problem regarding mean free path distribution of propagons and also sheds light on the design and performance of numerous a-Si based electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

We demonstrate that systematic ionization of a weak anionic polyelectrolyte, polyacrylic acid (PAA), resulting in extended and stiffened polymer chains with superior packing, can significantly enhance its thermal conductivity.

	abstract = {Thermal transport plays a crucial role in performance and reliability of semiconductor electronic devices, where heat is mainly carried by phonons. Phonon transport in crystalline semiconductor materials, such as Si, Ge, GaAs, GaN, etc, has been extensively studied over the past two decades. In fact, study of phonon physics in crystalline semiconductor materials in both bulk and nanostructure forms has been the cornerstone of the emerging field of ‘ nanoscale heat transfer ’. On the contrary, thermal properties of amorphous materials have been relatively less explored. Recently, however, a growing number of studies have re-examined the thermal properties of amorphous semiconductors, such as amorphous Si. These studies, which included both computational and experimental work, have revealed that phonon transport in amorphous materials is perhaps more complicated than previously thought. For instance, depending on the type of amorphous materials, thermal transport occurs via three types of vibrations: propagons, diffusons, and locons, corresponding to the propagating, diffusion, and localized modes, respectively. The relative contribution of each of these modes dictates the thermal conductivity of the material, including its magnitude and its dependence on sample size and temperature. In this article, we will review the fundamental principles and recent development regarding thermal transport in amorphous semiconductors.},

This review emphasizes developments in experiment, theory, and computation           in the past ten years and summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces become           increasingly important on small length scales. Research during the past decade has           extended studies of interfaces between simple metals and inorganic crystals to interfaces           with molecular materials and liquids with systematic control of interface chemistry and           physics.

Major advances in the physics           of phonons include first principles calculation of the phonon lifetimes of simple crystals           and application of the predicted scattering rates in parameter-free calculations of the           thermal conductivity. Progress in the control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is           critical to continued advances in the density of information that can be stored in phase           change memory devices and new generations of magnetic storage that will use highly           localized heat sources to reduce the coercivity of magnetic media. Ultralow thermal           conductivity—thermal conductivity below the conventionally predicted minimum thermal           conductivity—has been observed in nanolaminates and disordered crystals with strong           anisotropy. Advances in metrology by time-domain thermoreflectance have made measurements           of the thermal conductivity of a thin layer with micron-scale spatial resolution           relatively routine. Scanning thermal microscopy and thermal analysis using proximal probes           has achieved spatial resolution of 10 nm, temperature precision of 50 mK, sensitivity to           heat flows of 10 pW, and the capability for thermal analysis of sub-femtogram samples.},

The basic model is developed to link the amplitudes of vibrations to thermodynamics. The major method for measuring lattice dynamics is inelastic scattering of beams of neutrons and x-rays. We develop a simplified theory of inelastic scattering of radiation beams, and show how this can be used in instrumentation. Several examples are used to illustrate the theory.},

The crossover is found to be from a state of weak scattering to one of strong scattering, not vibrational localization. Three methods have been used to investigate the crossover: an analysis of the time evolution of a vibrational plane wave, a spectral-density analysis in frequency space, and an analysis of the final scattered state in momentum space. The first Ioffe-Regel crossover frequency is found by all three methods to be ∼1 THz for v−SiO2, for both longitudinal and transverse polarizations. A second Ioffe-Regel crossover occurs at ∼6 THz for v−SiO2, corresponding to the frequency at which the mean free path is minimal (comparable to the interatomic spacing), and the spectral-density width is maximal (comparable to the frequency range of the vibrational density of states).},

	abstract = {Glasses and other noncrystalline solids exhibit thermal and acoustic properties at low temperatures anomalously different from those found in crystalline solids, and with a remarkable degree of universality. Below a few kelvin, these universal properties have been successfully interpreted using the tunneling model, which has enjoyed (almost) unanimous recognition for decades. Here we present low-temperature specific-heat measurements of ultrastable glasses of indomethacin that clearly show the disappearance of the ubiquitous linear contribution traditionally ascribed to the existence of tunneling two-level systems (TLS). When the ultrastable thin-film sample is thermally converted into a conventional glass, the material recovers a typical amount of TLS. This remarkable suppression of the TLS found in ultrastable glasses of indomethacin is argued to be due to their particular anisotropic and layered character, which strongly influences the dynamical network and may hinder isotropic interactions among low-energy defects, rather than to the thermodynamic stabilization itself. This explanation may lend support to the criticisms by Leggett and others [Yu CC, Leggett AJ (1988) Comments Condens Matter Phys 14(4):231–251; Leggett AJ, Vural DC (2013) J Phys Chem B 117(42):12966–12971] to the standard tunneling model, although more experiments in different kinds of ultrastable glasses are needed to ascertain this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Using first-principles calculations, we study how to enhance thermal stability of high Ni compositional cathodes in Li-ion battery application. Using the archetype material LiNiO2 (LNO), we identify that ultrathin coating of Al2O3 (0001) on LNO(012) surface, which is the Li de-/intercalation channel, substantially improves the instability problem. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Al2O3 deposits show phase transition from the corundum-type crystalline (c-Al2O3) to amorphous (a-Al2O3) structures as the number of coating layers reaches three. Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations on the LNO(012) surface coated by a-Al2O3 (about 0.88 nm) with three atomic layers oxygen gas evolution is strongly suppressed at T = 400 K. We find that the underlying mechanism is the strong contacting force at the interface between LNO(012) and Al2O3 deposits, which, in turn, originated from highly ionic chemical bonding of Al and O at the interface. Furthermore, we identify that thermodynamic stability of the a-Al2O3 is even more enhanced with Li in the layer, implying that the protection for the LNO(012) surface by the coating layer is meaningful over the charging process. Our approach contributes to the design of innovative cathode materials with not only high-energy capacity but also long-term thermal and electrochemical stability applicable for a variety of electrochemical energy devices including Li-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular dynamics methodology have made it possible to study routinely the microscopic details of chemical processes in the condensed phase using high-speed computers. Thus, it is timely and useful to provide a pedagogical treatment of the theoretical and numerical aspects of modern molecular dynamics simulation techniques and to show several applications that illustrate the capability of these approaches. First, the standard Newtonian or Hamiltonian dynamics based method is presented followed by a discussion of theoretical advances related to non-Hamiltonian molecular dynamics. Examples of non-Hamiltonian molecular dynamics schemes capable of generating the canonical and isothermal−isobaric ensemble are analyzed. Next, the novel Liouville operator factorization approach to numerical integration is reviewed. The power and utility of this new technique are contrasted to more basic methods, particularly, in the development of multiple time scale and non-Hamiltonian integrators. Since the results of molecular dynamics simulations depend on the interparticle interactions employed in the calculations, modern empirical force fields and ab initio molecular dynamics approaches are discussed. An example calculation combining an empirical force field and novel molecular dynamics methods, the mutant T4 lysozyme M61 in water, will be presented. The combination of electronic structure with classical dynamics, the so called ab initio molecular dynamics method, will be described and an application to the structure of liquid ammonia discussed. Last, it will then be shown how the classical molecular dynamics methods can be adapted for quantum calculations using the Feynman path integral formulation of statistical mechanics. An application, employing both path integrals and ab initio molecular dynamics, to an excess proton in water will be presented.},

	abstract = {The embedded-atom method is a semi-empirical method for performing calculations of defects in metals. The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained. We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory. Where the EAM can be useful, there is a tremendous number of interesting projects that have yet to be carried out. The understanding of mechanical properties on an atomistic level has only just begun. For materials where the EAM is not expected to work well, there are recent developments which may allow calculations similar to those presented here. We have mentioned already the problem of treating directional bonding in semiconductors and elements from the transition series. One approach which promises to be useful for treating directional bonding is reviewed by Carlsson [70]; the interested reader is encouraged to start there.},

There is very good agreement between the structures obtained from computer simulation and those found experimentally. Bond lengths and the total correlation function do not change significantly with composition. The zinc and calcium bonding shows differences between composition: the distribution of Zn–Ca bond lengths becomes narrower with increasing Zn content, and the preference for Zn and Ca to avoid bonding to themselves or each other becomes less strong, and, for Zn–Ca, transforms into a positive preference to bond to each other. This transition occurs at about the same Zn content at which the behaviour on implantation changes, hinting at a possible structural connection. A very broad distribution of Voronoi polyhedra are also found, and this distribution broadens with increasing Zn content. The efficient cluster packing model, which is often used to describe the structure of bulk metallic glasses, was found not to describe these systems well.},

A number of pair-wise force fields have been shown to give the random tetrahedral network of silica glass. Further, potentials obtained by fitting quantum mechanical results exhibit many of the properties of silica such as the low thermal expansion and densification. However with these potentials densification is observed at temperatures much higher than experiment. We also show that the thermodynamic melting point of β-crystobalite similarly occurs at temperatures much higher than observed experimentally. Softer empirical potentials can be constructed that do give liquid properties at experimental temperatures. However in all cases the activation energies for diffusion are lower than the experimental activation energies for viscosity.},

The calculated values of the lattice constants, density, radial and bond-angle distribution functions, equations of state, and phase transitions using different potentials are compared to experimental values for polymorphs of silica: quartz, cristobalite, coesite, and stishovite. Simulation results with the BKS potential accurately predict the experimental measurements to within 2\%, and converge within a reasonable timeframe on an average workstation. The Pedone potential, also parameterized for other metallic oxides, computationally is slightly more expensive and is not as accurate. The simulations with both the CHIK and TTAM potentials are less accurate than with the BKS potential for modeling silica over the entire range of the phase diagram. The simulations with the Munetoh potential are by far the cheapest in terms of the modest computational requirements, but unsuitable for modeling crystalline silica. It could not produce the nature of the α–β and I–II phase transitions in quartz or the equation of state for stishovite silica, and the predicted structural properties sometimes differ from experimental values by more than 10\%.},

Here, we review the basic properties of NN potentials and describe their construction for materials like metals and oxides. The accuracy and efficiency are demonstrated using copper and zinc oxide as benchmark systems. First results for a potential of the combined ternary CuZnO system aiming at the description of oxide-supported copper clusters are reported.

This insight was derived from ab initio computer simulations, which provide an unbiased description of water at the atomic level and yield information on the underlying molecular forces. However, the high computational cost of such simulations prevents the systematic investigation of the influence of vdW forces on the thermodynamic anomalies of water. Here, we develop efficient ab initio-quality neural network potentials and use them to demonstrate that vdW interactions are crucial for the formation of water’s density maximum and its negative volume of melting. Both phenomena can be explained by the flexibility of the HB network, which is the result of a delicate balance of weak vdW forces, causing, e.g., a pronounced expansion of the second solvation shell upon cooling that induces the density maximum.},

For this application, insights into the thermal properties of such nanowires and, in particular, into the crystallization kinetics at the atomic level are crucial. Toward this end, we have performed large-scale atomistic simulations of ultrathin nanowires (9 nm in diameter) of the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. We made use of an interatomic potential generated by the neural network fitting of a large ab initio database to compute the thermal properties of the nanowires. By melting a portion of a nanowire, we investigated the velocity of recrystallization as a function of temperature. The simulations show that the melting temperature of the nanowire is about 100 K below the melting temperature of the bulk, which yields a reduction by about a factor of 2 of the maximum crystallization speed. Further, analysis of the structural properties of the amorphous phase of the nanowire suggests a possible origin of the reduction of the resistance drift observed experimentally in nanowires with respect to the bulk.},

The surface is semi-metallic, just like in the bulk, with the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum just touching with minimal overlap in the H–K region in the Brillouin Zone, so the electron affinity was identical to the work function.

It also examines the geometry and configurations of PCM containers and a series of numerical and experimental tests undertaken to assess the effects of parameters such as the inlet temperature and the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid (HTF). It is concluded that most of the phase change problems have been carried out at temperature ranges between 0°C and 60°C suitable for domestic heating applications. In terms of problem formulation, the common approach has been the use of enthalpy formulation. Heat transfer in the phase change problem was previously formulated using pure conduction approach but the problem has moved to a different level of complexity with added convection in the melt being accounted for. There is no standard method (such as British Standards or EU standards) developed to test for PCMs, making it difficult for comparison to be made to assess the suitability of PCMs to particular applications. A unified platform such as British Standards, EU standards needs to be developed to ensure same or similar procedure and analysis (performance curves) to allow comparison and knowledge gained from one test to be applied to another.},

	abstract = {The use of a latent heat storage system using phase change materials (PCMs) is an effective way of storing thermal energy and has the advantages of high-energy storage density and the isothermal nature of the storage process. PCMs have been widely used in latent heat thermal-storage systems for heat pumps, solar engineering, and spacecraft thermal control applications. The uses of PCMs for heating and cooling applications for buildings have been investigated within the past decade. There are large numbers of PCMs that melt and solidify at a wide range of temperatures, making them attractive in a number of applications. This paper also summarizes the investigation and analysis of the available thermal energy storage systems incorporating PCMs for use in different applications.},

	abstract = {Thermal energy storage (TES) is a technology with a high potential for different thermal applications. It is well known that TES could be the most appropriate way and method to correct the gap between the demand and supply of energy and therefore it has become a very attractive technology. In this paper, a review of TES for cold storage applications using solid–liquid phase change materials has been carried out. The scope of the work was focussed on different aspects: phase change materials (PCMs), encapsulation, heat transfer enhancement, and the effect of storage on food quality. Materials used by researchers as potential PCM at low temperatures (less than 20°C) are summarized and some of their thermophysical properties are reported. Over 88 materials that can be used as PCM, and about 40 commercially available PCM have been listed. Problems in long term stability of the materials, such as corrosion, phase segregation, stability under extended cycling or subcooling are discussed. Heat transfer is considered both from theoretical and experimental point of view and the different methods of PCM encapsulation are reviewed. Many applications of PCM at low temperature can be found, such as, ice storage, conservation and transport of temperature sensitive materials and in air conditioning, cold stores, and refrigerated trucks.},

	abstract = {Crystallization of an amorphous solid is usually accompanied by a significant change of transport properties, such as an increase in thermal and electrical conductivity. This fact underlines the importance of crystalline order for the transport of charge and heat. Phase-change materials, however, reveal a remarkably low thermal conductivity in the crystalline state. The small change in this conductivity upon crystallization points to unique lattice properties. The present investigation reveals that the thermal properties of the amorphous and crystalline state of phase-change materials show remarkable differences such as higher thermal displacements and a more pronounced anharmonic behavior in the crystalline phase. These findings are related to the change of bonding upon crystallization, which leads to an increase of the sound velocity and a softening of the optical phonon modes at the same time.},

In this paper we report on the ab initio calculations of bulk thermal conductivity of the prototypical phase change compounds Ge2Sb2Te5 and GeTe in their crystalline form. The related Sb2Te3 compound is also investigated for the sake of comparison. Thermal conductivity is obtained from the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation with phonon scattering rates computed within density functional perturbation theory. The calculations show that the large spread in the experimental data on the lattice thermal conductivity of GeTe is due to a variable content of Ge vacancies which at concentrations realized experimentally can halve the bulk thermal conductivity with respect to the ideal crystal. We show that the very low thermal conductivity of hexagonal Ge2Sb2Te5 of about 0.45 Wm−1K−1 measured experimentally is also resulting from disorder in the form of a random distribution of Ge/Sb atoms in one sublattice.},

	abstract = {A contending technology for nonvolatile memories of the next generation is based on a remarkable property of chalcogenide alloys known as phase change materials, namely their ability to undergo a fast and reversible transition between the amorphous and crystalline phases upon heating. The fast crystallization has been ascribed to the persistence of a high atomic mobility in the supercooled liquid phase, down to temperatures close to the glass transition. In this work we unravel the atomistic, structural origin of this feature in the supercooled liquid state of GeTe, a prototypical phase change compound, by means of molecular dynamic simulations. To this end, we employed an interatomic potential based on a neural network framework, which allows simulating thousands of atoms for tens of ns by keeping an accuracy close to that of the underlying first-principles framework. Our findings demonstrate that the high atomic mobility is related to the presence of clusters of slow and fast moving atoms. The latter contain a large fraction of chains of homopolar Ge–Ge bonds, which at low temperatures have a tendency to move by discontinuous cage-jump rearrangements. This structural fingerprint of dynamical heterogeneity provides an explanation of the breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation in GeTe, which is the ultimate origin of the fast crystallization of phase change materials exploited in the devices.},

The obtained positron lifetime results have been correlated with the size of the open volume (cavities) defects. We provide direct support for the ubiquitous voids which are found to be significantly larger in eutectic than the other compositions, where they include 25\% of the total volume. Contrary to natural belief, here we found that the crystalline state possesses a larger defect concentration than the corresponding glassy state. We have ascribed the origin of this paradoxical behaviour to larger electronic polarizability in the crystalline state which leads to easy formation of defects and thereby, a more disordered structure. On the other hand, formation of a chemically more ordered and rigid covalent network structure in the amorphous phase leads to smaller defect concentration. The present results demonstrate that both, the size of cavity and the concentration of defects play an important role in the fast reversible phase transition process.},

	abstract = {The thermal conduction characteristics of GeTe and Ge2Sb2Te5(GST) nanowires were investigated using an optical method to determine the local temperature by Raman spectroscopy. Since the localization of surface charge in a single-crystalline nanostructure can enhance charge-phonon scattering, the thermal conductivity value (κ) of single crystalline GeTe and GST nanowires was decreased significantly to 1.44 Wm–1 K–1 for GeTe and 1.13 Wm–1 K–1 for GST, compared to reported values for polycrystalline structures. The SET-to-RESET state in single-crystalline GeTe and GST nanowires are characteristic of a memory device. Unlike previous reports using GeTe and GST nanowires, the SET-to-RESET characteristics showed a bipolar switching shape and no unipolar switching. In addition, after multiple cycles of operation, a significant change in morphology and composition was observed without any structural phase transition, indicating that atoms migrate toward the cathode or anode, depending on their electronegativities. This change caused by a field effect indicates that the structural phase transition does not occur in the case of GeTe and GST nanowires with a significantly lowered thermal conductivity and stable crystalline structure. Finally, the formation of voids and hillocks as the result of the electromigration critically degrades device reliability.},

	abstract = {The thermal conductivity and thermal boundary resistance of GeTe and carbon doped GeTe thin films, designed for phase change memory (PCM) applications, were investigated by modulated photo thermal radiometry. It was found that C doping has no significant effect on the thermal conductivity of these chalcogenides in amorphous state. The thermal boundary resistance between the amorphous films and SiO 2 substrate is also not affected by C doping. The films were then crystallized by an annealing at 450°C as confirmed by optical reflectivity analysis. The thermal conductivity of non-doped GeTe significantly increases after crystallization annealing. But, surprisingly the thermal conductivity of the crystallized C doped GeTe was found to be similar from that of the amorphous state and independent of C concentration. As for the amorphous phase, C doping does not affect the thermal boundary resistance between the crystalline GeTe films and SiO 2 substrate. This behaviour is discussed thanks to XRD and FTIR analysis. In particular, XRD shows a decrease of crystalline grain size in crystalline films as C concentration is increased. FTIR analysis of the film before and after crystallization evidenced that this evolution could be attributed to the disappearing of Ge-C bonds and migration of C atoms out of the GeTe phase upon crystallization, limiting then the growth of GeTe crystallites in C-doped films.},

The low temperature specific heat measurements identified some localized low-frequency oscillation modes (Einstein modes) in conjunction with a Debye-like behavior. It was found that with increasing Se concentration the characteristic Debye temperature did not change whereas the Einstein temperature slightly decreased. The lattice thermal conductivity of all Ge20Te80−xSex samples exhibited typical amorphous heat conduction behavior, which has been discussed in connection with the phonon mean free path and in the context of a phenomenological model of heat conduction for highly disordered system.},

An atactic PVA chain of 30 repeating units in water at concentration of 3\% (w/w) has been simulated at 293, 303, and 323 K. The trajectory analysis has focused on the temperature influence on chain size, conformational properties and intramolecular hydrogen bonding of PVA.

Simulation results have been compared with available experimental data on PVA aqueous solutions, in order to evaluate the reliability of these force fields in the MD simulation of PVA-based systems in aqueous environment. Findings obtained from the simulations with the G45A4 force field have shown a better agreement with experimental results and have highlighted peculiar structural and dynamical characteristics of PVA in dilute aqueous solution. In particular, the simulation has shown a heterogeneity in the overall chain structure, not affected by temperature, and the absence of intrachain hydrogen bonds between nonadjacent residues. The trajectory analysis has revealed that the polymer influence on water structure and dynamics involves about six water molecules per PVA residue.},

	abstract = {Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is an amphiphilic macromolecule with surfactant activity. The peculiar behavior of this polymer at the water–air interface is at the basis of its use as material for hydrated microdevices, films, and nanofibers. This work aims to investigate the behavior of PVA and water within the surface domain of highly diluted aqueous solutions by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Monodisperse atactic oligomers of 30 residues were distributed within water slabs in a vacuum box and allowed to diffuse toward the surface. After equilibration, structural features and dynamical properties of polymer chains and water in the interfacial domains were analyzed as a function of PVA surface concentration at 293 K. Surface pressure values obtained from simulations are in agreement with experimental values at corresponding polymer specific surface areas. In the explored concentration range of 6–34 μmol of residues/m2, the chains display a transition between two states. At lower surface concentrations, elongated, quite rigid structures are adsorbed on the surface, whereas partially submerged globular aggregates, locally covered by thin water layers, are formed at higher surface concentrations. At PVA concentrations higher than about 20 μmol of residues/m2, the percolation of chain aggregates over the interface plane produces a surface-confined polymer network with stable pores filled by water molecules. A substantial slowing of polymer and water dynamics in the interfacial domains is highlighted by the mean squared displacement time behavior of terminal residues and the interaction time of PVA–water hydrogen bonding. The diffusion coefficient of water and lifetime of hydrogen bonds between solvent molecules are halved and doubled, respectively, at the interface with the highest polymer concentration. The attenuation of water and polymer mobility concur to stabilize PVA hydrated networks in contact with air.},

Model topology is supported by experimental network parameters, and simulation results are compared to an incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) investigation carried out on PVA hydrogels.1 From the QENS dynamic scattering law (part I),1 a random jump model was adopted for the description of water diffusion to extract a microscopic diffusion coefficient and a residence time between two “jumps”. In the present work, consistently with this framework, water diffusion parameters as diffusion coefficients and residence times have been evaluated using the mean square displacement of water in a time window of 10 ps and the time autocorrelation function of water hydrogen bonds. The calculated parameters are in good agreement with the experimental ones, giving confidence to this approach. Further developments are in progress to take into account a more realistic description of hydrogel structure in the molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {Nature has evolved many elegant solutions to enable life to flourish at low temperatures by either allowing (tolerance) or preventing (avoidance) ice formation. These processes are typically controlled by ice nucleating proteins or antifreeze proteins, which act to either promote nucleation, prevent nucleation or inhibit ice growth depending on the specific need, respectively. These proteins can be expensive and their mechanisms of action are not understood, limiting their translation, especially into biomedical cryopreservation applications. Here well-defined poly(vinyl alcohol), synthesized by RAFT/MADIX polymerization, is investigated for its ice nucleation inhibition (INI) activity, in contrast to its established ice growth inhibitory properties and compared to other synthetic polymers. It is shown that ice nucleation inhibition activity of PVA has a strong molecular weight dependence; polymers with a degree of polymerization below 200 being an effective inhibitor at just 1 mg.mL–1. Other synthetic and natural polymers, both with and without hydroxyl-functional side chains, showed negligible activity, highlighting the unique ice/water interacting properties of PVA. These findings both aid our understanding of ice nucleation but demonstrate the potential of engineering synthetic polymers as new biomimetics to control ice formation/growth processes},

Successful vitrification using several additives that inhibit ice nucleation in vitrification solutions has previously been reported. Among these additives, here we focused on a synthetic polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and investigated the effects of PVA on nucleation and growth of ice in 35\% (w/w) aqueous 1,2-propanediol solution by using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) system equipped with a cryomicroscope. First, the freezing temperature of the solution was measured using the DSC system, and then the change in ice fraction in the solution during cooling was evaluated based on images obtained using the cryomicroscope, at different concentrations of PVA between 0\% and 3\% (w/w). Based on the ice fraction, the change in residual solution concentration during cooling was also evaluated and then plotted on the state diagram of aqueous 1,2-propanediol solution. Results indicated that, when the partially glassy and partially frozen state was intentionally allowed, the addition of PVA effectively inhibited not only ice nucleation but also ice growth in the vitrification solution. The effect of PVA on ice growth in the vitrification solution was explained based on kinetic limitations mainly due to mass transport. The interfacial kinetics also might limit ice growth in the vitrification solution only when the ice growth rate decreased below a critical value. This coincides with the fact that PVA exhibits a unique antifreeze activity in the same manner as antifreeze proteins when ice growth rate is lower than a critical value.},

	abstract = {NMR on frozen solutions is an ideal method to study fundamental questions of macromolecular hydration, because the hydration shell of many biomolecules does not freeze together with bulk solvent. In the present study, we present previously undescribed NMR methods to study the interactions of proteins with their hydration shell and the ice lattice in frozen solution. We applied these methods to compare solvent interaction of an ice-binding type III antifreeze protein (AFP III) and ubiquitin a non-ice-binding protein in frozen solution. We measured 1H-1H cross-saturation and cross-relaxation to provide evidence for a molecular contact surface between ice and AFP III at moderate freezing temperatures of -35 °C. This phenomenon is potentially unique for AFPs because ubiquitin shows no such cross relaxation or cross saturation with ice. On the other hand, we detected liquid hydration water and strong water–AFP III and water–ubiquitin cross peaks in frozen solution using relaxation filtered 2H and HETCOR spectra with additional 1H-1H mixing. These results are consistent with the idea that ubiquitin is surrounded by a hydration shell, which separates it from the bulk ice. For AFP III, the water cross peaks indicate that only a portion of its hydration shell (i.e., at the ice-binding surface) is in contact with the ice lattice. The rest of AFP III’s hydration shell behaves similarly to the hydration shell of non-ice-interacting proteins such as ubiquitin and does not freeze together with the bulk water.},

Two different algorithms are used, reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and the dual-thermostat method. Particular attention is paid to the force field used. Four different models are tested, flexible and rigid bonds and all-atom and united-atom descriptions. They mainly differ in the number of high-frequency degrees of freedom retained. The calculated thermal conductivity depends systematically on the number of degrees of freedom of the model. This dependence is traced to the quantum nature of the fast molecular vibrations, which are incorrectly described by classical mechanics. The best agreement with experiment is achieved for a united-atom model with all bonds kept rigid. It could be shown that both the thermal conductivity and the heat capacity of a model show a similar (but not equal) dependence on its number of degrees of freedom. Hence, the computationally more convenient heat capacity can be used for force field optimization. A side result is the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity in stretched polyamide; heat conduction is faster parallel to the drawing direction than perpendicular to it.},

The temperature and frequency dependencies of the phonon dispersion and phonon relaxation times are obtained from lattice-dynamics calculations based on the results of molecular-dynamics simulations. No fitting parameters are required. The predicted thermal conductivities are in reasonable agreement with independent predictions made from the simulations using the Green-Kubo method. The assumption of an isotropic medium, as used in the Boltzmann transport equation formulation, leads to an overprediction of the Green-Kubo results at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, where anharmonic effects become increasingly important, the harmonic nature of the relaxation time calculation method leads to an underprediction of the Green-Kubo results. Assuming that the low-frequency behavior of the relaxation times can be extended over the entire frequency range, that there is no dispersion, or that the dispersion is independent of temperature, leads to significant errors in the predictions. This finding indicates that in analytical calculations, where such assumptions are often made, these errors are offset by the use of fitting parameters.},

	abstract = {Lattice thermal conductivities of zincblende- and wurtzite-type compounds with 33 combinations of elements are calculated with the single-mode relaxation-time approximation and a full solution of the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation from first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations. In nine zincblende-type compounds, distributions of phonon linewidths (inverse phonon lifetimes) are discussed in detail. The phonon linewidths vary nonsmoothly with respect to wave vector, which is explained from the imaginary parts of the self-energies. It is presented that detailed combination of phonon-phonon interaction strength and three-phonon selection rule is critically important to determine phonon lifetime for these compounds. This indicates difficulty to predict phonon lifetime quantitatively without anharmonic force constants. However, it is shown that joint density of states weighted by phonon numbers, which is calculated only from harmonic force constants, can be potentially used for a screening of the lattice thermal conductivity of materials.},

	abstract = {As a crystal is disordered, a point may be reached where the typical mean free path of phonons is so short that the wavelength and mean free path are no longer sharp concepts, and the textbook phonon-gas model for thermal conductivity breaks down. This paper proposes an alternate theory for the disordered regime, and the subsequent paper implements the theory for a realistic model of amorphous silicon. The idea is that the dominant scattering is correctly described by a harmonic Hamiltonian, which is, in principle, transformable into a one-body problem of decoupled oscillators. From this the thermal conductivity can be exactly calculated by an analog of the Kubo-Greenwood formula for electrical conductivity of disordered metals. Anderson localization is correctly contained in this theory; localized states contribute no currents in harmonic approximation. What is required is an atomistic model with a large unit cell and periodic boundary conditions (to avoid undesired surface effects). The linear size of the model should be larger than the mean free paths of the dominant phonons. A Kubo formula and then a Kubo-Greenwood-type formula are derived for this problem. A ‘‘mode diffusivity’’ Di for the ith exact oscillator state is defined. The heat is carried by off-diagonal elements of the heat current operator, which have a nonzero contribution because the temperature gradient introduces nonzero off-diagonal elements of the density matrix 〈a°iaj〉. An effort is made to interpret these results physically. Schemes for implementing this formalism are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that the continuous random network (CRN) model represents the structural topology of amorphous silicon. The key evidence is that the model can reproduce well experimental reduced density functions (RDFs) obtained by diffraction. By using a combination of electron diffraction and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) variance data as experimental constraints in a structural relaxation procedure, we show that the CRN is not unique in matching the experimental RDF. We find that inhomogeneous paracrystalline structures containing local cubic ordering at the 10 to 20 angstrom length scale are also fully consistent with the RDF data. Crucially, they also matched the FEM variance data, unlike the CRN model. The paracrystalline model has implications for understanding phase transformation processes in various materials that extend beyond amorphous silicon.
Amorphous silicon is more accurately described by a paracrystalline model, not the idealized continuous random network.

	abstract = {Understanding the structural origins of the properties of amorphous materials remains one of the most important challenges in structural science. In this study, we demonstrate that local “structural simplicity”, embodied by the degree to which atomic environments within a material are similar to each other, is a powerful concept for rationalizing the structure of amorphous silicon (a-Si) a canonical amorphous material. We show, by restraining a reverse Monte Carlo refinement against pair distribution function (PDF) data to be simpler, that the simplest model consistent with the PDF is a continuous random network (CRN). A further effect of producing a simple model of a-Si is the generation of a (pseudo)gap in the electronic density of states, suggesting that structural homogeneity drives electronic homogeneity. That this method produces models of a-Si that approach the state-of-the-art without the need for chemically specific restraints (beyond the assumption of homogeneity) suggests that simplicity-based refinement approaches may allow experiment-driven structural modeling techniques to be developed for the wide variety of amorphous semiconductors with strong local order.},

	abstract = {We present a new interatomic potential for solids and liquids called Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP). The SNAP potential has a very general form and uses machine-learning techniques to reproduce the energies, forces, and stress tensors of a large set of small configurations of atoms, which are obtained using high-accuracy quantum electronic structure (QM) calculations. The local environment of each atom is characterized by a set of bispectrum components of the local neighbor density projected onto a basis of hyperspherical harmonics in four dimensions. The bispectrum components are the same bond-orientational order parameters employed by the GAP potential [1]. The SNAP potential, unlike GAP, assumes a linear relationship between atom energy and bispectrum components. The linear SNAP coefficients are determined using weighted least-squares linear regression against the full QM training set. This allows the SNAP potential to be fit in a robust, automated manner to large QM data sets using many bispectrum components. The calculation of the bispectrum components and the SNAP potential are implemented in the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. We demonstrate that a previously unnoticed symmetry property can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of the force calculations by more than one order of magnitude. We present results for a SNAP potential for tantalum, showing that it accurately reproduces a range of commonly calculated properties of both the crystalline solid and the liquid phases. In addition, unlike simpler existing potentials, SNAP correctly predicts the energy barrier for screw dislocation migration in BCC tantalum.},

	abstract = {A multilayer feed-forward artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) with a single, hidden layer that contains a finite number of neurons can be regarded as a universal non-linear approximator. Today, the ANN method and linear regression (MLR) model are widely used for quantum chemistry (QC) data analysis (e.g., thermochemistry) to improve their accuracy (e.g., Gaussian G2–G4, B3LYP/B3-LYP, X1, or W1 theoretical methods). In this study, an alternative approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) is used, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) regression. It has been applied to ab initio (first principle) and density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemistry data. So, QC + SVM methodology is an alternative to QC + ANN one. The task of the study was to estimate the Møller–Plesset (MPn) or DFT (B3LYP, BLYP, BMK) energies calculated with large basis sets (e.g., 6-311G(3df,3pd)) using smaller ones (6-311G, 6-311G*, 6-311G**) plus molecular descriptors. A molecular set (BRM-208) containing a total of 208 organic molecules was constructed and used for the LS-SVM training, cross-validation, and testing. MP2, MP3, MP4(DQ), MP4(SDQ), and MP4/MP4(SDTQ) ab initio methods were tested. Hartree–Fock (HF/SCF) results were also reported for comparison. Furthermore, constitutional (CD: total number of atoms and mole fractions of different atoms) and quantum-chemical (QD: HOMO–LUMO gap, dipole moment, average polarizability, and quadrupole moment) molecular descriptors were used for the building of the LS-SVM calibration model. Prediction accuracies (MADs) of 1.62 ± 0.51 and 0.85 ± 0.24 kcal mol−1 (1 kcal mol−1 = 4.184 kJ mol−1) were reached for SVM-based approximations of ab initio and DFT energies, respectively. The LS-SVM model was more accurate than the MLR model. A comparison with the artificial neural network approach shows that the accuracy of the LS-SVM method is similar to the accuracy of ANN. The extrapolation and interpolation results show that LS-SVM is superior by almost an order of magnitude over the ANN method in terms of the stability, generality, and robustness of the final model. The LS-SVM model needs a much smaller numbers of samples (a much smaller sample set) to make accurate prediction results. Potential energy surface (PES) approximations for molecular dynamics (MD) studies are discussed as a promising application for the LS-SVM calibration approach.},

	abstract = {The computer simulation of condensed systems is a challenging task. While electronic structure methods like density-functional theory (DFT) usually provide a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency, they are computationally very demanding and thus applicable only to systems containing up to a few hundred atoms. Unfortunately, many interesting problems require simulations to be performed on much larger systems involving thousands of atoms or more. Consequently, more efficient methods are urgently needed, and a lot of effort has been spent on the development of a large variety of potentials enabling simulations with significantly extended time and length scales. Most commonly, these potentials are based on physically motivated functional forms and thus perform very well for the applications they have been designed for. On the other hand, they are often highly system-specific and thus cannot easily be transferred from one system to another. Moreover, their numerical accuracy is restricted by the intrinsic limitations of the imposed functional forms. In recent years, several novel types of potentials have emerged, which are not based on physical considerations. Instead, they aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible by using very general and flexible functional forms. In this review we will survey a number of these methods. While they differ in the choice of the employed mathematical functions, they all have in common that they provide high-quality potential-energy surfaces, while the efficiency is comparable to conventional empirical potentials. It has been demonstrated that in many cases these potentials now offer a very interesting new approach to study complex systems with hitherto unreached accuracy.},

Increasing TS results in a more ordered amorphous network with increases in nSi, v, G, and a decrease in bond angle disorder. Below 20 K, an excess C is seen in films with less than full density where it is typical of an amorphous solid, with both a linear term characteristic of two-level systems (TLS) and an additional (non-Debye) T3 contribution. The excess C is found to be independent of the elastic properties but to depend strongly on density. The density dependence suggests that low energy glassy excitations can form in a-Si but only in microvoids or low density regions and are not intrinsic to the amorphous silicon network. A correlation is found between the density of TLS n0 and the excess T3 specific heat cex suggesting that they have a common origin.},

There is excellent evidence that surface topography is a key factor in directing crystallization in real systems; however, the mechanisms by which nanoscale pits and pores promote nucleation remain unclear. Here, we use natural cleavage defects on Muscovite mica to investigate the activity of topographical features in the nucleation from vapor of ice and various organic crystals. Direct observation of crystallization within surface pockets using optical microscopy and also interferometry demonstrates that these sharply acute features provide extremely effective nucleation sites and allows us to determine the mechanism by which this occurs. A confined phase is first seen to form along the apex of the wedge and then grows out of the pocket opening to generate a bulk crystal after a threshold saturation has been achieved. Ice nucleation proceeds in a comparable manner, although our resolution is insufficient to directly observe a condensate before the growth of a bulk crystal. These results provide insight into the mechanism of crystal deposition from vapor on real surfaces, where this will ultimately enable us to use topography to control crystal deposition on surfaces. They are also particularly relevant to our understanding of processes such as cirrus cloud formation, where such topographical features are likely candidates for the “active sites” that make clay particles effective nucleants for ice in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Predicating macroscopic influences of drugs on human body, like efficacy and toxicity, is a central problem of small-molecule based drug discovery. Molecules can be represented as an undirected graph, and we can utilize graph convolution networks to predication molecular properties. However, graph convolutional networks and other graph neural networks all focus on learning node-level representation rather than graph-level representation. Previous works simply sum all feature vectors for all nodes in the graph to obtain the graph feature vector for drug predication. In this paper, we introduce a dummy super node that is connected with all nodes in the graph by a directed edge as the representation of the graph and modify the graph operation to help the dummy super node learn graph-level feature. Thus, we can handle graph-level classification and regression in the same way as node-level classification and regression. In addition, we apply focal loss to address class imbalance in drug datasets. The experiments on MoleculeNet show that our method can effectively improve the performance of molecular properties predication.},

	abstract = {How are water’s material properties encoded within the structure of the water molecule? This is pertinent to understanding Earth’s living systems, its materials, its geochemistry and geophysics, and a broad spectrum of its industrial chemistry. Water has distinctive liquid and solid properties: It is highly cohesive. It has volumetric anomalies—water’s solid (ice) floats on its liquid; pressure can melt the solid rather than freezing the liquid; heating can shrink the liquid. It has more solid phases than other materials. Its supercooled liquid has divergent thermodynamic response functions. Its glassy state is neither fragile nor strong. Its component ions—hydroxide and protons—diffuse much faster than other ions. Aqueous solvation of ions or oils entails large entropies and heat capacities. We review how these properties are encoded within water’s molecular structure and energies, as understood from theories, simulations, and experiments. Like simpler liquids, water molecules are nearly spherical and interact with each other through van der Waals forces. Unlike simpler liquids, water’s orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding leads to open tetrahedral cage-like structuring that contributes to its remarkable volumetric and thermal properties.},

	abstract = {Water freezes in a wide variety of low-temperature environments, from meteors and atmospheric clouds to soil and biological cells. In nature, ice usually nucleates at or near interfaces, because homogenous nucleation in the bulk can only be observed at deep supercoolings. Although the effect of proximal surfaces on freezing has been extensively studied, major gaps in understanding remain regarding freezing near vapor–liquid interfaces, with earlier experimental studies being mostly inconclusive. The question of how a vapor–liquid interface affects freezing in its vicinity is therefore still a major open question in ice physics. Here, we address this question computationally by using the forward-flux sampling algorithm to compute the nucleation rate in a freestanding nanofilm of supercooled water. We use the TIP4P/ice force field, one of the best existing molecular models of water, and observe that the nucleation rate in the film increases by seven orders of magnitude with respect to bulk at the same temperature. By analyzing the nucleation pathway, we conclude that freezing in the film initiates not at the surface, but within an interior region where the formation of double-diamond cages (DDCs) is favored in comparison with the bulk. This, in turn, facilitates freezing by favoring the formation of nuclei rich in cubic ice, which, as demonstrated by us earlier, are more likely to grow and overcome the nucleation barrier. The films considered here are ultrathin because their interior regions are not truly bulk-like, due to their subtle structural differences with the bulk.},

	abstract = {Freezing in the vicinity of water–vapor interfaces is of considerable interest to a wide range of disciplines, most notably the atmospheric sciences. In this work, we use molecular dynamics and two advanced sampling techniques, forward flux sampling and umbrella sampling, to study homogeneous nucleation of ice in free-standing thin films of supercooled water. We use a coarse-grained monoatomic model of water, known as mW, and we find that in this model a vapor–liquid interface suppresses crystallization in its vicinity. This suppression occurs in the vicinity of flat interfaces where no net Laplace pressure in induced. Our free energy calculations reveal that the pre-critical crystalline nuclei that emerge near the interface are thermodynamically less stable than those that emerge in the bulk. We investigate the origin of this instability by computing the average asphericity of nuclei that form in different regions of the film, and observe that average asphericity increases closer to the interface, which is consistent with an increase in the free energy due to increased surface-to-volume ratios.},

	abstract = {Pure water can be substantially supercooled below the melting temperature without transforming into ice. The achievable supercooling can be enhanced by adding solutes or by applying hydrostatic pressure. Avoiding ice formation is of great importance in the cryopreservation of food or biological samples. In this Letter, we investigate the similarity between the effects of pressure and salt on ice formation using a combination of state-of-the-art simulation techniques. We find that both hinder ice formation by increasing the energetic cost of creating the ice–fluid interface. Moreover, we examine the widely accepted proposal that the ice nucleation rate for different pressures and solute concentrations can be mapped through the activity of water [Koop, L.; Tsias, P. Nature, 2000, 406, 611]. We show that such a proposal is not consistent with the nucleation rates predicted in our simulations because it does not include all parameters affecting ice nucleation. Therefore, even though salt and pressure have a qualitatively similar effect on ice formation, they cannot be quantitatively mapped onto one another.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous nucleation of ice induced by organic materials is of fundamental importance for climate, biology, and industry. Among organic ice-nucleating surfaces, monolayers of long chain alcohols are particularly effective, while monolayers of fatty acids are significantly less so. As these monolayers expose to water hydroxyl groups with an order that resembles the one in the basal plane of ice, it was proposed that lattice matching between ice and the surface controls their ice-nucleating efficiency. Organic monolayers are soft materials and display significant fluctuations. It has been conjectured that these fluctuations assist in the nucleation of ice. Here we use molecular dynamic simulations and laboratory experiments to investigate the relationship between the structure and fluctuations of hydroxylated organic surfaces and the temperature at which they nucleate ice. We find that these surfaces order interfacial water to form domains with ice-like order that are the birthplace of ice. Both mismatch and fluctuations decrease the size of the preordered domains and monotonously decrease the ice freezing temperature. The simulations indicate that fluctuations depress the freezing efficiency of monolayers of alcohols or acids to half the value predicted from lattice mismatch alone. The model captures the experimental trend in freezing efficiencies as a function of chain length and predicts that alcohols have higher freezing efficiency than acids of the same chain length. These trends are mostly controlled by the modulation of the structural mismatch to ice. We use classical nucleation theory to show that the freezing efficiencies of the monolayers are directly related to their free energy of binding to ice. This study provides a general framework to relate the equilibrium thermodynamics of ice binding to a surface and the nonequilibrium ice freezing temperature and suggests that these could be predicted from the structure of interfacial water.},

The nanocomposites were fabricated by compression molding at 170 °C. The matrix PMMA was transformed into space filling polyhedra while the ATO nanoparticles distributed along the sharp edges of the matrix, forming a 3D interconnected network. The measured electrical resistivity showed that percolation was achieved in these materials at a very low ATO content of 0.99 wt \% ATO when monosize PMMA was used, whereas 1.48 wt \% ATO was needed to achieve percolation when the PMMA was polydispersed. A parametric finite element approach was chosen to model this unique microstructure-driven self-assembling percolation behavior. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to solve the effects of phase segregation between the matrix and the filler using a 2D simplified model in the frequency domain of the AC/DC module. It was found that the percolation threshold (pc) is affected by the size ratio between the matrix and the filler in a systematic way. Furthermore, simulations indicate that small deviations from perfect interconnection result mostly in changes in the electrical resistivity while the minimum DC resistivity achievable in any given composite is governed by the electrical conductivity of the filler, which must be accurately known in order to obtain an accurate prediction. The model is quite general and is able to predict percolation behavior in a number of other similarly processed segregated network nanocomposites.},

The stochastic nature and the inability to probe the small length and time scales associated with the nucleation process make it very difficult to experimentally determine the molecular level changes that lead to the nucleation event. Conversely, for this reason, there have been increasing efforts to obtain this information using molecular simulations. Accurate knowledge of how and when hydrate structures nucleate will be tremendously beneficial for the development of sustainable hydrate management strategies in oil and gas flowlines, as well as for their application in energy storage and recovery, gas separation, carbon sequestration, seawater desalination, and refrigeration. This article reviews various aspects of hydrate nucleation. First, properties of supercooled water and ice nucleation are reviewed briefly due to their apparent similarity to hydrates. Hydrate nucleation is then reviewed starting from macroscopic observations as obtained from experiments in laboratories and operations in industries, followed by various hydrate nucleation hypotheses and hydrate nucleation driving force calculations based on the classical nucleation theory. Finally, molecular simulations on hydrate nucleation are discussed in detail followed by potential future research directions.},

	abstract = {Understanding the nucleation of hydrate is the key to developing effective strategies for controlling methane hydrate formation. Here we present a computational study of methane hydrate nucleation, by combining the forward flux sampling (FFS) method and the coarse-grained water model mW. To facilitate the application of FFS in studying the formation of methane hydrate, we developed an effective order parameter λ on the basis of the topological analysis of the tetrahedral network. The order parameter capitalizes the signature of hydrate structure, i.e., polyhedral cages, and is capable of efficiently distinguishing hydrate from ice and liquid water while allowing the formation of different hydrate phases, i.e., sI, sII, and amorphous. Integration of the order parameter λ with FFS allows explicitly computing hydrate nucleation rates and obtaining an ensemble of nucleation trajectories under conditions where spontaneous hydrate nucleation becomes too slow to occur in direct simulation. The convergence of the obtained hydrate nucleation rate was found to depend crucially on the convergence of the spatial distribution for the spontaneously formed hydrate seeds obtained from the initial sampling of FFS. The validity of the approach is also verified by the agreement between the calculated nucleation rate and that inferred from the direct simulation. Analyzing the obtained large ensemble of hydrate nucleation trajectories, we show hydrate formation at 220 K and 500 bar is initiated by the nucleation events occurring in the vicinity of water–methane interface, and facilitated by a gradual transition from amorphous to crystalline structure. The latter provides the direct support to the proposed two-step nucleation mechanism of methane hydrate.},

	abstract = {Density fluctuations in liquid water are at the heart of numerous phenomena associated with hydrophobic effects such as protein folding and the interaction between biomolecules. One of the most fundamental processes in this regard is the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water. The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies examine density fluctuations at the short length scale focusing exclusively on spherical cavities. In this work, we use both first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that density fluctuations in liquid water can deviate significantly from the canonical spherical shapes. We show that regions of empty space are frequently characterized by exotic, highly asymmetric shapes that can be quite delocalized over the hydrogen bond network. Interestingly, density fluctuations of these shapes are characterized by Gaussian statistics with larger fluctuations. An important consequence of this is that the work required to create non spherical cavities can be substantially smaller than that of spheres. This feature is also qualitatively captured by the Lum–Chandler–Weeks theory. The scaling behavior of the free energy as a function of the volume at short length scales is qualitatively different for the nonspherical entities. We also demonstrate that nonspherical density fluctuations are important for accommodating the hydrophobic amino acid alanine and are thus likely to have significant implications when it comes to solvating highly asymmetrical species such as alkanes, polymers, or biomolecules.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structural and energetic requisites of ligand binding toward its molecular target is of paramount relevance in drug design. In recent years, atomistic free energy calculations have proven to be a valid tool to complement experiments in characterizing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of protein/ligand interaction. Here, we investigate, through a recently developed metadynamics-based protocol, the unbinding mechanism of an inhibitor of the pharmacologically relevant target p38 MAP kinase. We provide a thorough description of the ligand unbinding pathway identifying the most stable binding mode and other thermodynamically relevant poses. From our simulations, we estimated the unbinding rate as koff = 0.020 ± 0.011 s–1. This is in good agreement with the experimental value (koff = 0.14 s–1). Next, we developed a Markov state model that allowed identifying the rate-limiting step of the ligand unbinding process. Our calculations further show that the solvation of the ligand and that of the active site play crucial roles in the unbinding process. This study paves the way to investigations on the unbinding dynamics of more complex p38 inhibitors and other pharmacologically relevant inhibitors in general, demonstrating that metadynamics can be a powerful tool in designing new drugs with engineered binding/unbinding kinetics.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the fundamental interfacial mechanisms underlying electrofreezing (promotion of ice nucleation via the application of an electric field). Electrofreezing has been an active research topic for many decades, with applications in food preservation, cryopreservation, cryogenics and ice formation. There is substantial literature detailing experimental and simulations-based studies, which aim to understand the complex mechanisms underlying accelerated ice nucleation in the presence of electric fields and electrical charge. This work provides a critical review of all such studies. It is noted that application-focused studies of electrofreezing are excluded from this review; such studies have been previously reviewed in literature. This review focuses only on fundamental studies, which analyze the physical mechanisms underlying electrofreezing. Topics reviewed include experimental studies on electrofreezing (DC and AC electric fields), pyroelectricity-based control of freezing, molecular dynamics simulations of electrofreezing, and thermodynamics-based explanations of electrofreezing. Overall, it is seen that electrofreezing can enable disruptive advancements in the control of liquid-to-solid phase change, and that our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms can be significantly improved through further studies of various interfacial effects coming into play.},

	abstract = {Nanowires made of chalcogenide alloys are of interest for use in phase-change nonvolatile memories. For this application, insights into the thermal properties of such nanowires and, in particular, into the crystallization kinetics at the atomic level are crucial. Toward this end, we have performed large-scale atomistic simulations of ultrathin nanowires (9 nm in diameter) of the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. We made use of an interatomic potential generated by the neural network fitting of a large ab initio database to compute the thermal properties of the nanowires. By melting a portion of a nanowire, we investigated the velocity of recrystallization as a function of temperature. The simulations show that the melting temperature of the nanowire is about 100 K below the melting temperature of the bulk, which yields a reduction by about a factor of 2 of the maximum crystallization speed. Further, analysis of the structural properties of the amorphous phase of the nanowire suggests a possible origin of the reduction of the resistance drift observed experimentally in nanowires with respect to the bulk.},
