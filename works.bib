The fast crystallization is due to a high nucleation rate and a large crystal growth velocity which are actually possible thanks to the fragility of the supercooled liquid that allows for the persistence of a high atomic mobility at high supercooling where the thermodynamical driving force for crystallization is also high. Since crystallization in the devices occurs by rapidly heating the amorphous phase, hysteretic effects might arise with a different diffusion coefficient and viscosity on heating than on cooling. In this work, we have quantified these hysteretic effects in the phase change compound GeTe by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The atomic mobility in the overheated amorphous phase is lower than in supercooled liquid at the same temperature and the viscosity is consequently higher. Still, the simulations of the overheated amorphous phase reveal a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity, similarly to what we found previously in the supercooled liquid. Evidences are provided that the breakdown is due to the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities at high supercooling.}, language= {en}, urldate= {2015-10-28}, journal= {physica status solidi (a)}, author= {Sosso, G.

Despite the importance of heterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to microbiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still prevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the ability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a function of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation rates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal, varying the water?surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It turns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice, customarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice nucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other hand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity can significantly alter the ice nucleation rate and can also lead to the formation of up to three different faces of ice on the same substrate. We have pinpointed three circumstances where heterogeneous ice nucleation can be promoted by the crystalline surface: (i) the formation of a water overlayer that acts as an in-plane template; (ii) the emergence of a contact layer buckled in an ice-like manner; and (iii) nucleation on compact surfaces with very high interaction strength. We hope that this extensive systematic study will foster future experimental work aimed at testing the physiochemical understanding presented herein.}, number= {42}, urldate= {2015-11-06}, journal= {Journal of the American Chemical Society}, author= {Fitzner, Martin and Sosso, Gabriele C. and Cox, Stephen J. and Michaelides, Angelos}, month= {oct}, year= {2015}, pages= {13658--13669}, file= {ACS Full Text Snapshot:/Users/wolfandpixie/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/ijic45xn.default/zotero/storage/SEJFVR3X/jacs.html:text/html;Fitzner et al. - 2015 - The Many Faces of Heterogeneous Ice Nucleation In.pdf:/Users/wolfandpixie/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/ijic45xn.default/zotero/storage/MV89E5MT/Fitzner et al. - 2015 - The Many Faces of Heterogeneous Ice Nucleation In.pdf:application/pdf;SI.pdf:/Users/wolfandpixie/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/ijic45xn.default/zotero/storage/DNDZRIT5/Fitzner et al. - 2015 - The Many Faces of Heterogeneous Ice Nucleation In.pdf:application/pdf}}

By means of combined molecular dynamics and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory, we have unraveled the atomistic origin of the resistance drift in the prototypical phase-change compound GeTe. The drift results from a widening of the band gap and a reduction of Urbach tails due to structural relaxations leading to the removal of chains of Ge-Ge homopolar bonds.

In this work, we have investigated by means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations the crystal growth of the prototypical phase change compound GeTe at the interface between the crystalline and the supercooled liquid reached in the device upon heating the amorphous phase. A neural network interatomic potential, markedly faster with respect to first-principles methods, allowed us to consider high-symmetry crystalline surfaces as well as polycrystalline models that are very close to the actual geometry of the memory devices. We have found that the crystal growth from the interface is dominant at high temperatures while it is competing with homogeneous crystallization in the melt at lower temperatures. The crystal growth velocity markedly depends on the crystallographic plane exposed at the interface, the (100) surface being kinetically dominant with respect to the (111) surface.

The fast crystallization has been ascribed to the persistence of a high atomic mobility in the supercooled liquid phase, down to temperatures close to the glass transition. In this work we unravel the atomistic, structural origin of this feature in the supercooled liquid state of GeTe, a prototypical phase change compound, by means of molecular dynamic simulations. To this end, we employed an interatomic potential based on a neural network framework, which allows simulating thousands of atoms for tens of ns by keeping an accuracy close to that of the underlying first-principles framework. Our findings demonstrate that the high atomic mobility is related to the presence of clusters of slow and fast moving atoms. The latter contain a large fraction of chains of homopolar Ge?Ge bonds, which at low temperatures have a tendency to move by discontinuous cage-jump rearrangements.

GeTe is a phase change material of interest for applications in nonvolatile memories. An interatomic potential with close-to-ab initio accuracy was used as generated by fitting a huge ab initio database with a neural network method. It turns out that the majority of heat carriers are nonpropagating vibrations (diffusons), the small percentage of propagating modes giving a negligible contribution to the total value of κ. This result is in contrast with the properties of other amorphous semiconductors such as Si for which nonpropagating and propagating vibrations account for about one half of the value of κ each. This outcome suggests that the value of κ measured for the bulk amorphous phase can be used to model the thermal transport of GeTe and possibly of other materials in the same class also in nanoscaled memory devices. Actually, the contribution from propagating modes, which may endure ballistic transport at the scale of 10–20 nm, is negligible.}, number= {10}, urldate= {2014-07-02}, journal= {Physical Review B}, author= {Sosso, Gabriele C. and Donadio, Davide and Caravati, Sebastiano and Behler, Jörg and Bernasconi, Marco}, month= {sep}, year= {2012}, pages= {104301}, file= {APS Snapshot:/Users/wolf/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/k7dpptsb.default/zotero/storage/V5PS2R9D/PhysRevB.86.html:text/html;Sosso et al. - 2012 - Thermal transport in phase-change materials from a.pdf:/Users/wolf/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/k7dpptsb.default/zotero/storage/Q4D4UCZI/Sosso et al. - 2012 - Thermal transport in phase-change materials from a.pdf:application/pdf}}

It is demonstrated that the NN potential provides a close to ab initio quality description of a number of properties of liquid, crystalline, and amorphous GeTe. The availability of a reliable classical potential allows addressing a number of issues of interest for the technological applications of phase change materials, which are presently beyond the capability of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations.}, number= {17}, urldate= {2014-07-02}, journal= {Physical Review B}, author= {Sosso, Gabriele C. and Miceli, Giacomo and Caravati, Sebastiano and Behler, Jörg and Bernasconi, Marco}, month= {may}, year= {2012}, pages= {174103}, file= {APS Snapshot:/Users/wolf/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/k7dpptsb.default/zotero/storage/GCXKQ249/PhysRevB.85.html:text/html;Sosso et al. - 2012 - Neural network interatomic potential for the phase.pdf:/Users/wolf/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/k7dpptsb.default/zotero/storage/K8D8NMGC/Sosso et al. - 2012 - Neural network interatomic potential for the phase.pdf:application/pdf}}

Models of the amorphous phase were generated by quenching from the melt by means of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated spectra are in good agreement with experimental data which confirms the reliability of the models of the amorphous phase emerged from the simulations. All the features of the spectrum in both crystalline and amorphous GST can be assigned to vibrations of defective octahedra. The calculations reveal that the polarizability of the Sb-Te is much higher than that of Ge-Te bonds and of Ge-Ge/Sb wrong bonds resulting in a much lower Raman response of tetrahedra which are made of Ge-Te and wrong bonds. As a consequence and as opposed to amorphous GeTe, the signatures of tetrahedra in the Raman spectrum of amorphous GST are hidden by the larger Raman cross section of defective octahedra.}, number= {13}, urldate= {2014-07-02}, journal= {Physical Review B}, author= {Sosso, Gabriele C. and Caravati, Sebastiano and Mazzarello, Riccardo and Bernasconi, Marco}, month= {apr}, year= {2011}, pages= {134201}, file= {APS Snapshot:/Users/wolf/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/k7dpptsb.default/zotero/storage/EI44EIFM/PhysRevB.83.html:text/html;Sosso et al. - 2011 - Raman spectra of cubic and amorphous Ge_ 2 Sb_ 2 T.pdf:/Users/wolf/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/k7dpptsb.default/zotero/storage/UHK4M7UB/Sosso et al. - 2011 - Raman spectra of cubic and amorphous Ge_ 2 Sb_ 2 T.pdf:application/pdf}}

The three different stackings of the Ge/Sb planes proposed in the experimental literature were considered. The theoretical Raman spectrum is similar for the three stackings with a marginally better agreement with experiments for the structure proposed by Matsunaga et al (2004 Acta Crystallogr. B 60 685) which assumes a disorder in Ge/Sb site occupation. Although the large broadening of the experimental Raman peaks prevents discriminating among the different stackings, the assignment of the Raman peaks to specific phonons is possible because the main features of the spectrum are rather insensitive to the actual distribution of atoms in the Sb/Ge sublattices. On the basis of the energetics (including configurational entropy) two stackings seem plausible candidates for GST, but only the mixed stacking by Matsunaga et al reproduces the spread of Ge/Sb–Te bond lengths measured experimentally.}, language= {en}, number= {24}, urldate= {2014-07-02}, journal= {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter}, author= {Sosso, G.
